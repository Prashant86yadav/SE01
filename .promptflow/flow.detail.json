First off, congratulations on taking the first step! This article is an attempt at helping you go from that decision to landing on the learning resource that fits you best.\nThere are lots of cool tools out there, some aimed at beginners, some at advanced learners, some include programming, others games and interactive learning. And you, my friend, you may be a really motivated high school student (keep it up!), or an undergraduate student, trying to figure out whether this is your calling. Or you might be a professional scientist who deliberated that it’s time to pivot towards quantum computing and incorporate those key skills into your portfolio. Or yet you might be a manager within a small-medium industry, or a large corporation, and you feel you will soon need to take decisions which involve understanding the potential and applications of quantum computing to your specific field. You might be a math wizard, using your mathematical brain every day in your job, or you might feel quite rusty with the math, or even terrified to go back there.\nThe profiles and backgrounds of people looking to learn more about quantum computing can be very diverse. Yet, quantum computing is a complex and interdisciplinary field that includes theoretical physics and maths, engineering, electronics and programming. As scientists keep developing the hardware, we are starting to explore the applications space, which marries quantum computing with the specific application, be it pharmaceuticals, finance, battery development, chemical engineering and many more. On one hand, experts in those fields will be identifying the computational challenges they face, on the other quantum computing experts will be developing algorithms targeted to solving those challenges.\nSo, where should\nyou\nbegin?\nI’ve separated resources according to their level of detail and level of math, conscious especially of the fact that math is not a language that everyone is accustomed to.\nIntroductions to quantum computing\nNo maths\nLet’s begin with some\nshort videos\n:\nQuantum computers explained by Kurtzgesagt\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28&t=4s\nThe map of quantum computing by D.

Beginners can explore the field using tools like Qiskit, educational videos and books that cover quantum mechanics, algorithms and hardware fundamentals.\nQuantum computing is growing — in academia, but also commercially. Companies like IBM, Google and Microsoft are\nracing to build\nthe first fully-functioning quantum computer. In the past few years we’ve witnessed rapid development in quantum computing, on the hardware and software sides.\nCurrently, (very faulty) quantum computers\nactually exist\n. You can access them through the cloud and use them to execute codes written in Python or other programming languages. Making quantum computers\navailable online\nto anyone encourages more people to get into the field and see what the hype is all about.\nSo, if you’re curious about quantum computing and its potential to improve many fields including machine learning and artificial intelligence (not to mention the premise that it can solve problems\ncurrent computers fail to address\n), keep reading.\nWhat Is Quantum Computing?\nQuantum computing is a computing methodology that uses the power of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform faster computations. Accessing this power will allow us to overcome problems the current computer struggles to solve.\nHow to Learn Quantum Computing\nFinding suitable materials can be a hassle when someone tries to get into a new field; after all, the internet is full of good (and not-so-good) resources. In this article, I’ll go through some resources you can use to get started on your quantum computing learning journey. These materials will help you learn how to think about problems through a quantum lens, especially when it comes to quantum hardware, algorithms and circuits.\nHow to Learn Quantum Computing\nQiskit\nQuantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction\nIntroduction to Classical and Quantum Computing\nScience Without the Gobbeldygook\nQuantum Computation and Quantum Information\nQiskit\nIBM is one of the companies putting a lot of effort into building a quantum community; they’re behind the most-used quantum computing Python package,\nQiskit\n.\nQiskit (quantum information science kit) is an open-source Python package that allows you to implement, simulate and run quantum algorithms on IBM’s actual hardware. If you’re looking for an excellent place to start learning everything quantum, look no further than the\nQiskit YouTube channel\nand\ntextbook\n.\nThe\nQiskit channel\ncovers the fundamentals of quantum computing and details  how you can implement these fundamentals using code. The channel is active and they post new content every week.\nIf you’re an absolute beginner to the world of quantum computing, the\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Hardware\nplaylist is the best place to start.\nAlthough the Qiskit YouTube channel goes in-depth about various aspects of quantum computing, some people (myself included) prefer to have written documentation in addition to a video tutorial. Having written content makes it easier to actually practice with the code or solve some exercises. For that, I recommend giving the\nQiskit textbook\na read. Like the YouTube channel, IBM continuously updates the textbook. In fact, IBM is currently working on a new version of an interactive book that will allow you to have a more comprehensive learning experience.\nMore From Sara A.

First off, congratulations on taking the first step! This article is an attempt at helping you go from that decision to landing on the learning resource that fits you best.\nThere are lots of cool tools out there, some aimed at beginners, some at advanced learners, some include programming, others games and interactive learning. And you, my friend, you may be a really motivated high school student (keep it up!), or an undergraduate student, trying to figure out whether this is your calling. Or you might be a professional scientist who deliberated that it’s time to pivot towards quantum computing and incorporate those key skills into your portfolio. Or yet you might be a manager within a small-medium industry, or a large corporation, and you feel you will soon need to take decisions which involve understanding the potential and applications of quantum computing to your specific field. You might be a math wizard, using your mathematical brain every day in your job, or you might feel quite rusty with the math, or even terrified to go back there.\nThe profiles and backgrounds of people looking to learn more about quantum computing can be very diverse. Yet, quantum computing is a complex and interdisciplinary field that includes theoretical physics and maths, engineering, electronics and programming. As scientists keep developing the hardware, we are starting to explore the applications space, which marries quantum computing with the specific application, be it pharmaceuticals, finance, battery development, chemical engineering and many more. On one hand, experts in those fields will be identifying the computational challenges they face, on the other quantum computing experts will be developing algorithms targeted to solving those challenges.\nSo, where should\nyou\nbegin?\nI’ve separated resources according to their level of detail and level of math, conscious especially of the fact that math is not a language that everyone is accustomed to.\nIntroductions to quantum computing\nNo maths\nLet’s begin with some\nshort videos\n:\nQuantum computers explained by Kurtzgesagt\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28&t=4s\nThe map of quantum computing by D.

Beginners can explore the field using tools like Qiskit, educational videos and books that cover quantum mechanics, algorithms and hardware fundamentals.\nQuantum computing is growing — in academia, but also commercially. Companies like IBM, Google and Microsoft are\nracing to build\nthe first fully-functioning quantum computer. In the past few years we’ve witnessed rapid development in quantum computing, on the hardware and software sides.\nCurrently, (very faulty) quantum computers\nactually exist\n. You can access them through the cloud and use them to execute codes written in Python or other programming languages. Making quantum computers\navailable online\nto anyone encourages more people to get into the field and see what the hype is all about.\nSo, if you’re curious about quantum computing and its potential to improve many fields including machine learning and artificial intelligence (not to mention the premise that it can solve problems\ncurrent computers fail to address\n), keep reading.\nWhat Is Quantum Computing?\nQuantum computing is a computing methodology that uses the power of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform faster computations. Accessing this power will allow us to overcome problems the current computer struggles to solve.\nHow to Learn Quantum Computing\nFinding suitable materials can be a hassle when someone tries to get into a new field; after all, the internet is full of good (and not-so-good) resources. In this article, I’ll go through some resources you can use to get started on your quantum computing learning journey. These materials will help you learn how to think about problems through a quantum lens, especially when it comes to quantum hardware, algorithms and circuits.\nHow to Learn Quantum Computing\nQiskit\nQuantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction\nIntroduction to Classical and Quantum Computing\nScience Without the Gobbeldygook\nQuantum Computation and Quantum Information\nQiskit\nIBM is one of the companies putting a lot of effort into building a quantum community; they’re behind the most-used quantum computing Python package,\nQiskit\n.\nQiskit (quantum information science kit) is an open-source Python package that allows you to implement, simulate and run quantum algorithms on IBM’s actual hardware. If you’re looking for an excellent place to start learning everything quantum, look no further than the\nQiskit YouTube channel\nand\ntextbook\n.\nThe\nQiskit channel\ncovers the fundamentals of quantum computing and details  how you can implement these fundamentals using code. The channel is active and they post new content every week.\nIf you’re an absolute beginner to the world of quantum computing, the\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Hardware\nplaylist is the best place to start.\nAlthough the Qiskit YouTube channel goes in-depth about various aspects of quantum computing, some people (myself included) prefer to have written documentation in addition to a video tutorial. Having written content makes it easier to actually practice with the code or solve some exercises. For that, I recommend giving the\nQiskit textbook\na read. Like the YouTube channel, IBM continuously updates the textbook. In fact, IBM is currently working on a new version of an interactive book that will allow you to have a more comprehensive learning experience.\nMore From Sara A.

First off, congratulations on taking the first step! This article is an attempt at helping you go from that decision to landing on the learning resource that fits you best.\nThere are lots of cool tools out there, some aimed at beginners, some at advanced learners, some include programming, others games and interactive learning. And you, my friend, you may be a really motivated high school student (keep it up!), or an undergraduate student, trying to figure out whether this is your calling. Or you might be a professional scientist who deliberated that it’s time to pivot towards quantum computing and incorporate those key skills into your portfolio. Or yet you might be a manager within a small-medium industry, or a large corporation, and you feel you will soon need to take decisions which involve understanding the potential and applications of quantum computing to your specific field. You might be a math wizard, using your mathematical brain every day in your job, or you might feel quite rusty with the math, or even terrified to go back there.\nThe profiles and backgrounds of people looking to learn more about quantum computing can be very diverse. Yet, quantum computing is a complex and interdisciplinary field that includes theoretical physics and maths, engineering, electronics and programming. As scientists keep developing the hardware, we are starting to explore the applications space, which marries quantum computing with the specific application, be it pharmaceuticals, finance, battery development, chemical engineering and many more. On one hand, experts in those fields will be identifying the computational challenges they face, on the other quantum computing experts will be developing algorithms targeted to solving those challenges.\nSo, where should\nyou\nbegin?\nI’ve separated resources according to their level of detail and level of math, conscious especially of the fact that math is not a language that everyone is accustomed to.\nIntroductions to quantum computing\nNo maths\nLet’s begin with some\nshort videos\n:\nQuantum computers explained by Kurtzgesagt\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28&t=4s\nThe map of quantum computing by D.

Beginners can explore the field using tools like Qiskit, educational videos and books that cover quantum mechanics, algorithms and hardware fundamentals.\nQuantum computing is growing — in academia, but also commercially. Companies like IBM, Google and Microsoft are\nracing to build\nthe first fully-functioning quantum computer. In the past few years we’ve witnessed rapid development in quantum computing, on the hardware and software sides.\nCurrently, (very faulty) quantum computers\nactually exist\n. You can access them through the cloud and use them to execute codes written in Python or other programming languages. Making quantum computers\navailable online\nto anyone encourages more people to get into the field and see what the hype is all about.\nSo, if you’re curious about quantum computing and its potential to improve many fields including machine learning and artificial intelligence (not to mention the premise that it can solve problems\ncurrent computers fail to address\n), keep reading.\nWhat Is Quantum Computing?\nQuantum computing is a computing methodology that uses the power of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform faster computations. Accessing this power will allow us to overcome problems the current computer struggles to solve.\nHow to Learn Quantum Computing\nFinding suitable materials can be a hassle when someone tries to get into a new field; after all, the internet is full of good (and not-so-good) resources. In this article, I’ll go through some resources you can use to get started on your quantum computing learning journey. These materials will help you learn how to think about problems through a quantum lens, especially when it comes to quantum hardware, algorithms and circuits.\nHow to Learn Quantum Computing\nQiskit\nQuantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction\nIntroduction to Classical and Quantum Computing\nScience Without the Gobbeldygook\nQuantum Computation and Quantum Information\nQiskit\nIBM is one of the companies putting a lot of effort into building a quantum community; they’re behind the most-used quantum computing Python package,\nQiskit\n.\nQiskit (quantum information science kit) is an open-source Python package that allows you to implement, simulate and run quantum algorithms on IBM’s actual hardware. If you’re looking for an excellent place to start learning everything quantum, look no further than the\nQiskit YouTube channel\nand\ntextbook\n.\nThe\nQiskit channel\ncovers the fundamentals of quantum computing and details  how you can implement these fundamentals using code. The channel is active and they post new content every week.\nIf you’re an absolute beginner to the world of quantum computing, the\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Hardware\nplaylist is the best place to start.\nAlthough the Qiskit YouTube channel goes in-depth about various aspects of quantum computing, some people (myself included) prefer to have written documentation in addition to a video tutorial. Having written content makes it easier to actually practice with the code or solve some exercises. For that, I recommend giving the\nQiskit textbook\na read. Like the YouTube channel, IBM continuously updates the textbook. In fact, IBM is currently working on a new version of an interactive book that will allow you to have a more comprehensive learning experience.\nMore From Sara A.
