You receive:
- The user's original query: "{{ user_query }}"

User query: {{ user_query }}

Body: {{ body }}
Cover image: {{ cover_image }}
References: {{ references }}

Your tasks:
- Use the user query as context for how to structure and expand the article.
- Use the "headline" as the main article title.
- Organize the body text into clear sections with subheadings (e.g., "Introduction", "Main Points", "Tips", "FAQs", etc.), based on both the topic and the userâ€™s query.
- Add subheadings or reformat existing ones as needed for clarity and flow.
- Ensure each section is split into multiple paragraphs (avoid long, unbroken text).
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for steps, key tips, or recommendations, if appropriate.
- Add tables in Markdown if helpful for comparisons or summaries wherever required.

Expand and Enrich:
- If the draft is sparse or misses key points, add practical context, examples, or advice from your own knowledge.
- Answer related questions or common concerns that a reader might have about the topic, even if not explicitly in the draft.

References:
- At the end, add a References section, listing the top 5 sources (with url and snippet).

Suggested Images:
- Add a Suggested Images section with up to 5 images that best illustrate the article. Provide relevant images using your knowledge base and from website.
- For each, provide an image_url and a short caption of 2-3 words.

Output the result as this JSON (no commentary or markdown):
