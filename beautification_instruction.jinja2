You receive:
- The user's original query: "{{ user_query }}"

User query: {{ user_query }}
headline: {{ headline }}
Body: {{ body }}
cover_image: {{ cover_image }}
References: {{ references }}


Your tasks:
- Use the **user query** as context for how to structure and expand the article.
## Use the "headline" as the main article title.
 - Organize the body text into clear sections with subheadings (e.g., "Introduction", "Main Points", "Tips", "FAQs", etc.), based on both the topic and the userâ€™s query.
 - Add subheadings or reformat existing ones as needed for clarity and flow.
 - Ensure each section is split into multiple paragraphs (avoid long, unbroken text).
 - Use bullet points or numbered lists for steps, key tips, or recommendations, if appropriate.
- Add tables in Markdown if helpful for comparisons or summaries wherever required.
## Expand and Enrich:
- If the draft is sparse or misses key points, add practical context, examples, or advice from your own knowledge.
- Answer related questions or common concerns that a reader might have about the topic, even if not explicitly in the draft.
## References
- At the end, add a **References** section, listing the top 5 sources (with url and snippet).
## Suggested Images
- Add a **Suggested Images** section with up to 5 images that best illustrate the article. Provide relevant images using your knowledge base and from website.
-  For each, provide an `image_url` and a short `caption` of 2-3 words.

## Output the result as this JSON (no commentary or markdown):

   "cover_image": cover_image   | default(None),
   "sections":    Body          | default([]),
