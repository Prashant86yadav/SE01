contribution\n1 of 5 bubbles\nbad experience with SOTC\nI am writing to formally express my deep dissatisfaction with the services provided during the Durga Puja tour to France and Switzerland via SOTC, which took place from 8th to 16th October 2024, originating from Kolkata. We were under the impression that booking through SOTC would ensure a well-managed and enjoyable trip, especially given it was our second international trip with your agency. However, our recent experience was far below acceptable standards, and I feel compelled to escalate this matter for your serious consideration.\n\nHere are the key issues we encountered:\n\nSupport and Guidance During the Tour:\n\nOn the day of visiting the Eiffel Tower, due to a misunderstanding in a heavy rainstorm, we exited through a different gate. When we reached out to our tour manager, Mr. sampat, for assistance, we received inadequate support. Instead of guiding us back, we were instructed to make our own way back to the restaurant, which was both confusing and distressing given the circumstances. The lack of follow-up and his dismissive attitude toward our situation was particularly disheartening. Additionally, his handling of the group's needs, especially regarding the cruise trip and basic amenities like restroom facilities, showed a clear lack of empathy and service orientation.\n\nSince we were completely wet, so opted out of the Cruise trip. We were there for around 2 hours. So my wife, requested for toilet but the tour manager told us that you could go for toilet but bus gate will open only when every member comes back & it was heavily raining. What is this? Completely ruthless behavior. Why is this discrimination against us?\n\nAccommodation:\n\nContrary to the promise of at least 4-star accommodations, the hotels provided (except for Novotel in Zurich) were substandard. The locations, especially in France, were inconveniently far from city centers, making independent exploration impractical. The hotel was far from city ( probably 30 k.m) & since Paris visit was totally spoied by rain, we could not visit any location even at our own cost.\n\nItinerary and Tour Management:\n\nThe choice of places visited in Paris was limited and did not include iconic attractions like the Louvre Museum or the Mona Lisa, essential for a comprehensive experience of Paris. Furthermore, the inflexible schedule, even in adverse weather conditions, and the inability to accommodate reasonable requests like altering of  visiting Disneyland, despite the feasibility observed with on-the-spot ticket purchases, showed a lack of responsiveness. \n\nWe felt abandoned and neglected during what was supposed to be a memorable vacation after paying such a huge price. This experience has not only disappointed us but has also severely impacted our perception of SOTC's commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\nEven after writing this mail to their branch manager ( Kolkata) & even in customer care - nothing happened ( a auto reply mail has come from some Mrs Khan)\n\nDeeply unsatisfied & will consider somebody else next time.\nRead more\nReview of:\nSOTC for Holidays\nVisited\nOctober 2024\nTraveled\nas a couple\nWritten\nNovember 8, 2024\nHarpreet Singh\nPatiala, India\n11 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nGreat experience!\nWe had a great experience in Kashmir arranged with help of Premiere Tours and travels. Mr. Auyub is a very professional guy and he took utmost care that our stay and travel was comfortable.\nMuzaffar was our tour guide and he drove us to several places throughout our week trip.

Javed Sir ensured that our journey was smooth and safe, regularly checking in on us. Despite last-minute arrangements, all our stays were comfortable and well-managed.

The people we encountered were humble and kind, making our experience even more memorable.\nRead more\nReview of:\nApharwat Tour And Travels\nVisited\nOctober 2024\nTraveled\nwith friends\nWritten\nOctober 25, 2024\nVenkata Katari\nHyderabad, India\n11 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nJannat is Kashmir + experience with MTB Kashmir team\nWe are a small group of recreational cyclists, fitness enthusiasts, and nature lovers who do one cycling tour yearly. Kashmir has been on our bucket list for a long time. When searching for a tour organizer who can help, I have come across MTB Kashmir. I have spent many hours talking to Sheen Bhai to understand what they do and how they support me. Sheen and the team being cyclists themselves were more convincing for me to go with them because only a cyclist can know better what another cyclist wants from the tour. And also we have added a few trekking days as it is Kashmir. It is our first trekking experience. We did it from Aug 2nd to 10th.\n\nAt the end of the tour, I am happy that, I have taken the right decision to go with MTB Kashmir. I went with lots of apprehensions to Srinagar but then returned back with so much confidence to plan more tours in Kashmir and also got a good friendly team in Kashmir. Their local expertise helped at every stage like taking detours when a road was blocked, providing support despite vehicles blocked and only cyclists allowed on a particular stretch, changing the plan and accommodating our needs when we had to change our trek plan, arranging accommodation with in a day notice, etc. The homestay and the hospitality we got can never be forgotten. The friendly and very affectionate conversation support from Sheen, Arshad, Ajaj, and his entire team is just amazing! 10/10 for the entire team. Before going to the trek, we named our tour \"Jannat e Kashmir\" due to its serene locations but then even our experience was Jannat! And lastly, I must say that the cycles we got were top-notch! We have never experienced such great quality cycles in any another tour cycles provided by other organisers.\nRead more\nReview of:\nMTB Kashmir\nVisited\nAugust 2024\nTraveled\nwith friends\nWritten\nAugust 12, 2024\nFearless53556318043\nGuwahati, India\n2 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nAwesome  and memorable experience\nWe have reached Ardkuwari at 12.45 am and take short rest at shilputri Bhawan dormitory.

It was like a badly organized school picnic rather than a professionally planned trip. The itinerary was dismal, offering little to no sightseeing or meaningful experiences. \n\nOur days were structured in a frustrating manner\u2014waking up at 6 AM, having breakfast at 7 AM, and departing at 8 AM, only to face hours of wasted time without any substantial activities. Clearly that no thought was given to optimizing the schedule or ensuring a smooth & enjoyable experience.\n\nWhat made this even more frustrating was the fact that we paid over 35% more for this package compared to other operators offering similar itineraries. Despite the inflated price, the quality of the hotels selected was shockingly poor & the breakfasts disappointing. Felt like we were getting far less than what we paid for & it was a slap in the face to experience such mediocrity after paying a premium.\n\nThe execution of the tour was appalling. Not only were we subjected to unnecessary travel, but we were also forced to travel over an hour to Indian restaurants, which added no value to the trip & felt like a complete waste of time. It was a constant string of inconveniences and poorly made decisions, all of which contributed to making the experience incredibly frustrating.\n\nA poorly planned & horribly executed trip. SOTC has failed to deliver on its quality. It is clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for this company, and I am deeply dissatisfied with the overall experience. Will never use your services again & will actively discourage anyone I know from doing so.\nRead more\nReview of:\nSOTC for Holidays\nVisited\nDecember 2024\nTraveled\nwith family\nWritten\nJanuary 1, 2025\nSima H\n1 contribution\n5 of 5 bubbles\nGreat tour of Casablanca\nA great tour of Casablanca \nEasy to book, well organised and professional \nI was picked up by my driver Yousef who took me to the start of the tour at Hasan II Mosque .

contribution\n1 of 5 bubbles\nbad experience with SOTC\nI am writing to formally express my deep dissatisfaction with the services provided during the Durga Puja tour to France and Switzerland via SOTC, which took place from 8th to 16th October 2024, originating from Kolkata. We were under the impression that booking through SOTC would ensure a well-managed and enjoyable trip, especially given it was our second international trip with your agency. However, our recent experience was far below acceptable standards, and I feel compelled to escalate this matter for your serious consideration.\n\nHere are the key issues we encountered:\n\nSupport and Guidance During the Tour:\n\nOn the day of visiting the Eiffel Tower, due to a misunderstanding in a heavy rainstorm, we exited through a different gate. When we reached out to our tour manager, Mr. sampat, for assistance, we received inadequate support. Instead of guiding us back, we were instructed to make our own way back to the restaurant, which was both confusing and distressing given the circumstances. The lack of follow-up and his dismissive attitude toward our situation was particularly disheartening. Additionally, his handling of the group's needs, especially regarding the cruise trip and basic amenities like restroom facilities, showed a clear lack of empathy and service orientation.\n\nSince we were completely wet, so opted out of the Cruise trip. We were there for around 2 hours. So my wife, requested for toilet but the tour manager told us that you could go for toilet but bus gate will open only when every member comes back & it was heavily raining. What is this? Completely ruthless behavior. Why is this discrimination against us?\n\nAccommodation:\n\nContrary to the promise of at least 4-star accommodations, the hotels provided (except for Novotel in Zurich) were substandard. The locations, especially in France, were inconveniently far from city centers, making independent exploration impractical. The hotel was far from city ( probably 30 k.m) & since Paris visit was totally spoied by rain, we could not visit any location even at our own cost.\n\nItinerary and Tour Management:\n\nThe choice of places visited in Paris was limited and did not include iconic attractions like the Louvre Museum or the Mona Lisa, essential for a comprehensive experience of Paris. Furthermore, the inflexible schedule, even in adverse weather conditions, and the inability to accommodate reasonable requests like altering of  visiting Disneyland, despite the feasibility observed with on-the-spot ticket purchases, showed a lack of responsiveness. \n\nWe felt abandoned and neglected during what was supposed to be a memorable vacation after paying such a huge price. This experience has not only disappointed us but has also severely impacted our perception of SOTC's commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\nEven after writing this mail to their branch manager ( Kolkata) & even in customer care - nothing happened ( a auto reply mail has come from some Mrs Khan)\n\nDeeply unsatisfied & will consider somebody else next time.\nRead more\nReview of:\nSOTC for Holidays\nVisited\nOctober 2024\nTraveled\nas a couple\nWritten\nNovember 8, 2024\nHarpreet Singh\nPatiala, India\n11 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nGreat experience!\nWe had a great experience in Kashmir arranged with help of Premiere Tours and travels. Mr. Auyub is a very professional guy and he took utmost care that our stay and travel was comfortable.\nMuzaffar was our tour guide and he drove us to several places throughout our week trip. He knows all places all around very well and he helped us a lot in booking local vehicles wherever necessary.\nRead more\nReview of:\nPremier Tour and Travels\nVisited\nJune 2024\nTraveled\nwith family\nWritten\nJanuary 7, 2025\nNikita\n10 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nKashmir\nI highly recommend Apharwat Tour and Travels. Javed Sir ensured that our journey was smooth and safe, regularly checking in on us. Despite last-minute arrangements, all our stays were comfortable and well-managed. Khalid Sir, who drove us through Kashmir, was extremely helpful. The people we encountered were humble and kind, making our experience even more memorable.\nRead more\nReview of:\nApharwat Tour And Travels\nVisited\nOctober 2024\nTraveled\nwith friends\nWritten\nOctober 25, 2024\nVenkata Katari\nHyderabad, India\n11 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nJannat is Kashmir + experience with MTB Kashmir team\nWe are a small group of recreational cyclists, fitness enthusiasts, and nature lovers who do one cycling tour yearly. Kashmir has been on our bucket list for a long time. When searching for a tour organizer who can help, I have come across MTB Kashmir. I have spent many hours talking to Sheen Bhai to understand what they do and how they support me. Sheen and the team being cyclists themselves were more convincing for me to go with them because only a cyclist can know better what another cyclist wants from the tour. And also we have added a few trekking days as it is Kashmir. It is our first trekking experience. We did it from Aug 2nd to 10th.\n\nAt the end of the tour, I am happy that, I have taken the right decision to go with MTB Kashmir. I went with lots of apprehensions to Srinagar but then returned back with so much confidence to plan more tours in Kashmir and also got a good friendly team in Kashmir. Their local expertise helped at every stage like taking detours when a road was blocked, providing support despite vehicles blocked and only cyclists allowed on a particular stretch, changing the plan and accommodating our needs when we had to change our trek plan, arranging accommodation with in a day notice, etc. The homestay and the hospitality we got can never be forgotten. The friendly and very affectionate conversation support from Sheen, Arshad, Ajaj, and his entire team is just amazing! 10/10 for the entire team. Before going to the trek, we named our tour \"Jannat e Kashmir\" due to its serene locations but then even our experience was Jannat! And lastly, I must say that the cycles we got were top-notch!

It was like a badly organized school picnic rather than a professionally planned trip. The itinerary was dismal, offering little to no sightseeing or meaningful experiences. \n\nOur days were structured in a frustrating manner\u2014waking up at 6 AM, having breakfast at 7 AM, and departing at 8 AM, only to face hours of wasted time without any substantial activities. Clearly that no thought was given to optimizing the schedule or ensuring a smooth & enjoyable experience.\n\nWhat made this even more frustrating was the fact that we paid over 35% more for this package compared to other operators offering similar itineraries. Despite the inflated price, the quality of the hotels selected was shockingly poor & the breakfasts disappointing. Felt like we were getting far less than what we paid for & it was a slap in the face to experience such mediocrity after paying a premium.\n\nThe execution of the tour was appalling. Not only were we subjected to unnecessary travel, but we were also forced to travel over an hour to Indian restaurants, which added no value to the trip & felt like a complete waste of time. It was a constant string of inconveniences and poorly made decisions, all of which contributed to making the experience incredibly frustrating.\n\nA poorly planned & horribly executed trip. SOTC has failed to deliver on its quality. It is clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for this company, and I am deeply dissatisfied with the overall experience. Will never use your services again & will actively discourage anyone I know from doing so.\nRead more\nReview of:\nSOTC for Holidays\nVisited\nDecember 2024\nTraveled\nwith family\nWritten\nJanuary 1, 2025\nSima H\n1 contribution\n5 of 5 bubbles\nGreat tour of Casablanca\nA great tour of Casablanca \nEasy to book, well organised and professional \nI was picked up by my driver Yousef who took me to the start of the tour at Hasan II Mosque .

      "content": "29\nAug 2023\nBest places in Kashmir to visit in summer\nby\nSuvendu Rout\n|\nposted in:\nIndia\n,\nNorth India\n|\n6\nNature doesn\u2019t need pen and paper to write poetry, nor does it need words. It writes poetry with landscapes; with flowing rivers and serene lakes; with gorgeous vistas of mountains and valleys. Kashmir is pure, sublime poetry. Its landscape is blessed with high mountains that turn white in winters. On the other hand, it\u2019s resplendent with Chinar trees that turn red and yellow with the coming of autumn. And come summer, the landscape turns lush green. Kashmir is a delight in all seasons. However, here I\u2019m gonna talk about summer only.\nA friend\n(Santosh/ Bablu)\nrecently\nasked me for tips on the best places in Kashmir to visit in summer. So, this piece is dedicated to him.\n\"Agar firdaus bar roo-e zameen ast |\nHameen ast-o, hameen ast-o, hameen ast.\"\n(words in Farsi)\nIn English:\n\"If there is a paradise on earth |\nIt is this, it is this, it is this\u201d\nAmir Khusrau\nIndian scholar, poet,  singer\nYes, Kashmir indeed is heaven on earth. I know it\u2019s cliche, but I can\u2019t help it; this is what comes to my mind first while thinking about Kashmir. I would actually go a step further to say that heaven might actually look like Kashmir, rather than Kashmir resembling heaven. Because Kashmir is for real, while heaven is imaginary! No wonder then that it\u2019s the most sought after natural-destination in India.\nThough Kashmir is an all-season destination, summer is when it receives the most visitors, because it\u2019s the most pleasant during that time.\nWhile writing this article on the best places in Kashmir for summer,\nI draw mostly from experiences of my summer 2017 family trip.\n{More such Himalayan destinations:\nMussoorie\n|||\nDalhousie\n|||\nGreat Himalayan National Park\n}\nKashmir, heaven on earth\nKashmir is indeed heaven on earth\nIf you are a landscape lover, or a nature lover, there is perhaps no better place than Kashmir. From overwhelming heights of the Himalayas to pleasing meadows, from snow-clad white mountain views to lush green hills, from charming lakes to beautiful gardens, it\u2019s a complete paradise.\nApart from Lakshadweep, Kashmir is the only place where Muslims have a majority in India. What this means is that a more than thousand-year old thriving Islamic culture to explore. Their food, clothes, craft, dance, music and language are all very unique partly and partly inspired by the middle-east.\nHowever, in this article, I\u2019m presenting only the natural beauty of Kashmir with a focus on the best places in Kashmir to visit in summer.\n{Read about more destinations in the region:\nLeh- Ladakh\n|||\nVaishno Devi\n}\nIs Kashmir safe for travellers?\nFirst things first. The first question on the mind of first-time travellers to Kashmir is whether Kashmir is safe to travel.\nThough I have forgotten the name of our driver for the trip, I would never forget his words. He said in Hindi mixed with\nKashmiri dialect:\n\u201c\nSaheb, Kashmir se jyada khaetirdari aur mehmannawazi aapko duniya mein kahin nahi milegi\n\u201c, meaning: \u201cSir, you won\u2019t experience better hospitality and warmth\nanywhere in the world\nthan in Kashmir\u201d. He further added, \u201c\nHaan humare masle kai saare hain, par hum apne mehmanon ko isme nahi uljhate hain. Sine pe goli kha lenge, magar apne mehmanon ko kuchh na hone denge\n\u201c, meaning: \u201cYes, we have our issues, but we never bother our guests with any of them. We can take the bullets on our chest rather than harming our guests\u201d.\nHe echoed exactly how we felt while visiting across the state. Everywhere we went, from hotels to shops, from people on the street to officials, everyone was welcoming, and helpful through out. I don\u2019t remember even one unpleasant incident anywhere.\nWhile he shared his anger and disenchantment regarding the political situation in the state (I don\u2019t want to share his specific views here), he was particularly courteous in explaining to us their predicament.\nSpending time with locals | Doodhpathri\nPolitical violence doesn\u2019t affect tourists\nWhile political violence in Kashmir\nhas a long history, one would rarely hear about violence against or involving tourists. There are two main reasons for this. First, Kashmiris in general (and people of hills all over) are naturally warm and lovable; they take their hospitality very seriously. Two, economy of Kashmir heavily depends on tourism.\nSo, they take special care that tourists have a safe time there.\nSo, tourists are safe and happy in Kashmir. No need to worry. Just keep normal precautions like one would generally keep while travelling anywhere else. Keep your eyes and ears open. Don\u2019t argue with people, especially avoid political arguments. Yes, you may try to listen to them, and their side of the story, and do respect their views. It actually helps. Moreover, it can actually change your perspective.\nA summer experiencing the best places in Kashmir\nIn my younger days, I have heard my mom say many a times that she wanted to visit Kashmir at least once in life. At last, she had the opportunity of visiting her dream destination. In fact, Kashmir perhaps is a dream destination for all Indians.\nIn the summer of 2017, we decided to visit Kashmir for the first time along with the family of a childhood friend. We were seven of us: I, Parina and maa (mom), and four of my friend\u2019s family- Asha, Manas and their two kids. It was a five-day trip covering five places: Srinagar, Pahalgam, Gulmarg, Sonmarg and Doodhpathri.\nDal Lake with the Himalayas\nFive Best Places in Kashmir to visit in summer\nKashmir is beautiful through out the year. It\u2019s pleasant in summers, and bone chilling cold in the winters. However, a lot of people visit there in the winter for snow-sports and enjoying the views of white mountainous landscape. In this article though, I\u2019m going to share my experiences of the best places in Kashmir to visit in summer.\nEvery inch of Kashmir is so beautiful that I find it difficult to pick the best places in Kashmir. So, it\u2019s only for a practical travel-planning purpose that I\u2019m sharing my experiences of the five best places in Kashmir. Each of these five places is different from the other with a special character of its own.\nWhile Srinagar is the capital city and is especially famous for its iconic Dal lake, Gulmarg is a great place for snow-experience. Pahalgam has the best meadows and valley views. If you want to feel a glacier under your feet, Sonmarg is the place for you. Last but not the least, if you want peaceful idyllic charm of a river flowing in a valley, Doodhpathri is the best place.\nThere are quite a few other wonderful places in Kashmir, but for a first-timer, especially in summer, these are the best places to choose.\nIf you want to have a plan:\nIn case you are a first time traveller, and a five day trip makes sense for you, here\u2019s a suggestive plan:\nDay-1:\nArrive in Srinagar, check in; explore the iconic gardens; evening at\nDal lake\nDay-2:\nPre-lunch: local Srinagar (gardens and mosques); post-lunch: Doodhpathri\nDay-3:\nPahalgam; pony ride to Baisaran valley\nDay-4:\nVisit Gulmarg, take the gondola ride, relax on the meadows\nDay-5:\nVisit Sonmarg, relax on the meadows; hike up to Thajiwas glacier.\nFor your planning convenience, here\u2019s an indicative map marked with the best places in Kashmir to visit in the summer.\nKashmir Tourist Map | Source: Googlemaps\nSrinagar\nWithout shadow of a doubt, Srinagar is the most beautiful city in India, and one of the best places in Kashmir to visit any time of the year. The capital city offers the most number of things to do. However, the three quintessential things that Srinagar is known for are the picturesque Dal Lake, the iconic gardens and its beautiful mosques.\nNot to forget the rich history and cultural heritage of the city as well. Established at least 1500 years ago, the city has passed through a number of distinct cultural phases, and still retains some of those characters. I park the idea of a detailed presentation of the city for a later article. Here I\u2019m just giving a snapshot of the best places/ experiences not to miss.\nShikara ride in Dal Lake:\nI always love a boat ride in the calm waters of a lake. From the backwaters of Alleppey to the lake city\nUdaipur\n(click) and the hill station of\nNainital\n(click),\u00a0lakes are at the center of all tourist attractions. Dal lake is no exception. But for me, the charm of a shikara (small boat) ride in Dal lake is unmatchable.\nShikara ride in Dal lake\nWith the great Himalayas in the backdrop, the calm blue waters of the lake make for a spectacular sight. The colourful shikars took us around the lake, first to a peaceful part, and then through the floating markets of Dal lake. I found the shikara-vendors selling\nkahwa\n(a Kashmiri hot beverage), and other craft products to be a very interesting sight. However, riding a boat through the floating shops\nmostly\nselling Kashmiri hand-made textile products was absolutely fascinating.\nAnother memorable experience at the lake was visiting the Gulshan Book-Cafe. Do ask your shikara rider for the cafe and spend an hour there.\nPassing through the floating market\nHouseboats of Dal Lake:\nThough people call them houseboats, I prefer calling them boat-houses as they are not boats in real meaning of the term. Unlike boats, they don\u2019t really float around the lake; they float, but are stuck to the ground on the bank of the lake. They are bigger than the houseboats of\nAlleppey in Kerala\n, and give an experience of a resort.\nThough we didn\u2019t have the opportunity of staying in the houseboats, I\u2019m sure that watching sunrises and sunsets must be special experiences from those houseboats. Moreover, they look fascinating enough from within the lake to go around them.\nHouseboats | Dal Lake\nGardens of Srinagar:\nSrinagar has to be the city with maximum number of beautiful gardens in India.\u00a0 Though Bangalore,\nOoty\n, Kodaikanal and\nDelhi\nwould give it a stiff competition, still Srinagar would win it hands down! In fact, t\nhe gardens of Srinagar are easily comparable to and often better than those in Europe (see:\nParis\n|||\nGeneva\n|||\nAmsterdam\n).\nAmong the most beautiful gardens in Srinagar, the three Mughal Gardens come to my mind first:\nNishat Bagh\n|\nShalimar Bagh | Chasme Shahi Garden\n. Nishat Bagh is the largest one, and the most impressive. Situated on the foothills of Zabarwan mountains (part of Pir Panjal range of Himalayas) on one side, and Dal lake on the other, one cannot ask for better views! The terraced garden is a feast to the eyes with hundreds of varieties of flowers, and the magnificent Chinar trees (that resemble maple trees). It has been enchanting the visitors since 1633!\nView of Dal lake from Pari Mahal\nApart from the Mughal Gardens, the other must-visit gardens are:\nPari Mahal\n|\nIndira Gandhi Tulip Garden\n(Asia\u2019s largest tulip garden) |\nNehru Memorial Botanical Garden | Harwan Garden | Naseem Bagh, in descending order of my favorites list.\nFor want of time, if you want to prioritize, at least visit the ones in bold letters above. Pari Mahal gives the best panoramic view of the Dal lake.\nPlease note that the Tulip garden opens only from end-March to April, the spring-summer season.\nPopular Muslim shrines in Srinagar:\nIrrespective of whether you want to visit the shrines of Srinagar for reasons of faith or not, they are absolutely worth visiting for their architectural beauty. The two most important Muslim shrines in Srinagar are the Hazratbal Shrine and the Jamia Masjid.\nHazratbal Shrine\nHazratbal shrine:\nBuilt in the 17th century, this is one of the most important Muslim shrines in India as it hosts strands of hair of the Prophet Muhammed himself! The shrine, also known as Dargah Sharif, is as much popular among locals as among travellers. It has a long and quite\ninteresting history\n(click to read).\nFor a long time, it has been a symbol of Kashmir\u2019s communal harmony.\nWe spent an evening at the shrine and loved the experience. From the shrine\u2019s campus, the panoramic view of the lake with a backdrop of the mountains was quite a spectacle. We sat there at the steps leading to the lake for more than an hour.\nJamia Masjid:\nThe most important mosque in Srinagar, Jamia\nMasjid\nwas first built in 1402. Afterwards, it was rebuilt by the Mughals. I loved its architecture especially because of its novelty. Instead of the regular dome structure, it has a pyramidal shape, mostly inspired by Persian architectural style, with some resemblance with Buddhist Pagodas.\nEnamored by its unique design (by seeing in pictures), I had decided to definitely visit this mosque. On the last day of our trip, while coming back from Sonmarg to catch our flight, we were actually running a little late. Still then, I requested our driver to make a quick stop at the mosque.\nIn spite of suffering severe damages due to major fires three times in its history, it still dazzles as ever, and can host up to 33000 worshippers at a time.\nJamia Mosque, Srinagar\nDoodhpathri\nFor me, the second in the list of best places to visit in Kashmir in summer is Doodhpathri (literally: milky-rock). Though many visitors give it a miss, we made it a point to spend a good part of a day here. In fact, not having a large crowd was a major reason for enjoying the views and tranquility even more. Could you believe, i\nt\u2019s just about 45 kms from Srinagar, but still is a hidden gem!\nWe loved its enchanting meadows and the valley with river Shaliganga flowing through milky white rock beds.\nThe valley has two major points of attraction: the meadows and the river valley.\nDoodhpathri Valley\nFirst we headed to the river point where we crossed over to the other side over a small wooden bridge. Indeed, true to its name the rock bed looked milky white, and the water too looked white! Shaliganga river flowing through the pine forests over the white rock bed made for a painting-like scenery.\nWhile coming back, we stopped over at the meadows. What a pleasant sight that was! With very few tourists around, we went up to a picnicking local family to strike a nice chat. I loved having conversation with a local shepherd who was attending to his sheep grazing at the meadow. Whenever next time I\u2019m in Srinagar, I\u2019ll try to revisit this charming place.\nA shepherd | Doodhpathri\nPahalgam\nPahalgam (90 kms from Srinagar) is famous for its stunning valleys like Betaab valley, Aru valley and Baisaran valley. On reaching Pahalgam, we realized that not all the valley are reachable by car. From Pahalgam, there are two routes. While one goes towards Betaab valley and Chandanwadi, the other takes you to Aru valley and Lidder river valley. One of Kashmir\u2019s most beautiful treks, the\nTarsar-Marsar lake trek\nbegins from Aru.\n{Similar reading suggestion:\nCamping in Zanskar- Ladakh\n|||\nTriund Trekking\n}\nHowever, to reach the most stunning beauty of them all- the Baisaran valley, one must take a pony ride. On that ride only, they take you to a few more view points like Dabyan, Deno valley and Kashmir valley.\nBaisaran Valley, a hidden gem\nWe took that difficult pony ride across the hills to the Baisaran valley, which people fondly call \u2018Mini Switzerland\u2019. It was raining a bit before we reached Pahalgam. So, the narrow pathway up the hill was slippery, which made the ride even more difficult. However, it was okay, as even my mom could take the ride. In fact, she enjoyed the challenge of that trecherous ride. As they say, the best views come after the hardest journey.\nOnce we reached the Baisaran valley, one view of the hidden meadow, and all our pain was gone! It was a stunning sight with snow-capped mountains (Pir Panjal range) and deep green pine forests surrounding the valley. We spent more than half a day there walking around the lush green grounds and taking pictures with rabbits and pigeons.\nPahalgam undoubtedly, has to be there in the top five best places in Kashmir to visit in the summer.\nParina enjoying with the pigeons\nGulmarg\nNext on the list of best places to visit in Kashmir in summer has to be Gulmarg, 50 kms away from Srinagar.\nIt offers the best winter sports avenues in India. However, w\ninter is a difficult time for me to tolerate the chilling cold. So, even t\nhough Gulmarg is a round-the-year destination, I prefer the summer.\nIn summer, one can take the gondola (cable car) ride up to the snow point, and enjoy some skiing as well. Moreover, the large meadow with a small hill, atop which there is a small Shiva temple makes for a gorgeous sight. From near this central meadow, one has to take the gondola.\nAll of us in Gulmarg\nThe Gondola ride:\nFor us, the most awaited activity of the trip was taking this gondola ride.\nWe reached there late in the morning, and took the gondola right away to the snow point. We had to wear those long boots and extra-jackets that we got from a vendor. However, I don\u2019t think it was really necessary. Maybe the boot was a bit helpful, but the jacket was not required (the normal jacket that we were wearing, would have been enough).\nThe view from the gondola was wonderful, and the ride was exciting, to say the least. At the top, walking over the snow, the smile on the face of my mother was very special to me. She was so happy! Parina did some skiing, but I don\u2019t like trying out these things for 30 minutes!\nThe gondola ride has two phases. We rode up to phase-1 only. From the end of phase-2, one can trek up to (5 kms) the Alpather lake, beyond which is the Apharwat peak.\nOnce back to the central meadows, we took a pony ride around the meadow. The snow-clad mountains overlooking the green meadow was a stunning sight! There is a small market near the meadows, where we had our modest lunch, and left for Srinagar to reach before the evening.\nParina trying skiing | Gulmarg\nThings to do in Gulmarg:\nGondola ride to snow point; enjoy snow sports up there\nWalk around the central meadow and hike up to the Shiva temple\nTrekking to Alpather lake; the lake remains partially frozen even in the summer. Alternately, one can take a pony ride, or gondola ride to reach there.\nRide a pony up to Khilanmarg (only 5 kms away)\nPlay golf at the golf course just on the outskirts of Gulmarg\nSonmarg\nLast but not the least, Sonmarg has to be there on the list of best places in Kashmir to visit in summer. We visited this gorgeous valley on the last day of our trip. It\u2019s about 90 kms from Srinagar, and takes about 2 hrs to reach.\nWhen we drove up to Sonmarg in May, the roads were cut through thick layers of snow! So, the route doesn\u2019t open till late April or May; and they close in late October.\nSince this route goes towards Ladakh,\u00a0the view of snow-clad mountains gets more frequent on this route. All over the route, the sight of small streams formed out of the glaciers, flowing between two mountains makes the route picture perfect!\nSonmarg is famous for the lakes and the treks. We were a big group with my mom being part of it. So, trekking was out of question. However, we did hike up to the Thajiwas glacier (9186 ft), the origin of Sind river. Standing on the awe-inspiring glacier was an amazing experience.\nIf you have time, you may explore the nearby areas of Baltal valley and Zoji La pass.

But our trip had a bit of everything: from boat rides to gondola rides, from romancing the tranquil waters of the lake to encountering the snowy mountains, we had it all. Whenever people have asked me about my favorite landscape experience, Kashmir has always sprung up in my mind first. It\u2019s just picture perfect. Even if you take a picture with your eyes closed, you won\u2019t be disappointed with the output.\nHowever, I remember Kashmir not only for its natural beauty.\nIt was not only rejuvenating for the battered soul, but also enriching for the hungry mind. I always wanted to experience that mystical land that is heaven on one hand and the center of many a controversies/ conflicts on the other. I haven\u2019t shared much of my interactions with the locals and their viewpoints for obvious reasons. But those conversations were indeed an eye-opener.\nI hope this piece on the best places in Kashmir to visit in the summer is enjoyable for your reading, and is also helpful for your planning. Or, you can always write to us for more details.\nRelated",

Nature doesn’t need pen and paper to write poetry, nor does it need words. It writes poetry with landscapes; with flowing rivers and serene lakes; with gorgeous vistas of mountains and valleys. Kashmir is pure, sublime poetry. Its landscape is blessed with high mountains that turn white in winters. On the other hand, it’s resplendent with Chinar trees that turn red and yellow with the coming of autumn. And come summer, the landscape turns lush green. Kashmir is a delight in all seasons. However, here I’m gonna talk about summer only.

When writing your answer:
- Synthesize all information into a single, well-structured article, as if writing for Wikipedia or a high-end magazine feature.
- Start with a concise, user-friendly title.
- Pick a relevant cover image from any of the articles (preferably the most illustrative, not a logo).
- Organize your article into clear, multi-paragraph sections and subtopics (e.g., "Origins", "Modern Debates", "Key Concepts", etc.), using all sources and adding new sections, subtopics, or expert context wherever needed to ensure a comprehensive answer.
- You are encouraged to expand with background, key debates, practical tips, related questions, or deeper explanations wherever appropriate. If something is expert knowledge or context beyond the URLs, clearly indicate this.
- Support each main point or section with relevant references (URL, snippet, image, favicon) wherever possible. Add additional references as needed to support or clarify claims.
- Make the writing flow like an expert blog or Wikipedia feature—not a list of summaries.

For images:
- For each main section or for the overall article, if there are no suitable images in the provided sources, suggest up to 5 real image URLs (from Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, or reputable educational/public sources) that best illustrate the topic, each with a brief caption. Use your knowledge of the public web to select highly relevant and high-quality images.

At the end, add up to 5 key references (`url`, `snippet`, `favicon_url`, `image_url`, `image_alt`) that best support your answer. If you use any suggested web images not from the sources, include their URL and caption in a "suggested_images" field.

contribution\n1 of 5 bubbles\nbad experience with SOTC\nI am writing to formally express my deep dissatisfaction with the services provided during the Durga Puja tour to France and Switzerland via SOTC, which took place from 8th to 16th October 2024, originating from Kolkata. We were under the impression that booking through SOTC would ensure a well-managed and enjoyable trip, especially given it was our second international trip with your agency. However, our recent experience was far below acceptable standards, and I feel compelled to escalate this matter for your serious consideration.\n\nHere are the key issues we encountered:\n\nSupport and Guidance During the Tour:\n\nOn the day of visiting the Eiffel Tower, due to a misunderstanding in a heavy rainstorm, we exited through a different gate. When we reached out to our tour manager, Mr. sampat, for assistance, we received inadequate support. Instead of guiding us back, we were instructed to make our own way back to the restaurant, which was both confusing and distressing given the circumstances. The lack of follow-up and his dismissive attitude toward our situation was particularly disheartening. Additionally, his handling of the group's needs, especially regarding the cruise trip and basic amenities like restroom facilities, showed a clear lack of empathy and service orientation.\n\nSince we were completely wet, so opted out of the Cruise trip. We were there for around 2 hours. So my wife, requested for toilet but the tour manager told us that you could go for toilet but bus gate will open only when every member comes back & it was heavily raining. What is this? Completely ruthless behavior. Why is this discrimination against us?\n\nAccommodation:\n\nContrary to the promise of at least 4-star accommodations, the hotels provided (except for Novotel in Zurich) were substandard. The locations, especially in France, were inconveniently far from city centers, making independent exploration impractical. The hotel was far from city ( probably 30 k.m) & since Paris visit was totally spoied by rain, we could not visit any location even at our own cost.\n\nItinerary and Tour Management:\n\nThe choice of places visited in Paris was limited and did not include iconic attractions like the Louvre Museum or the Mona Lisa, essential for a comprehensive experience of Paris. Furthermore, the inflexible schedule, even in adverse weather conditions, and the inability to accommodate reasonable requests like altering of  visiting Disneyland, despite the feasibility observed with on-the-spot ticket purchases, showed a lack of responsiveness. \n\nWe felt abandoned and neglected during what was supposed to be a memorable vacation after paying such a huge price. This experience has not only disappointed us but has also severely impacted our perception of SOTC's commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\nEven after writing this mail to their branch manager ( Kolkata) & even in customer care - nothing happened ( a auto reply mail has come from some Mrs Khan)\n\nDeeply unsatisfied & will consider somebody else next time.\nRead more\nReview of:\nSOTC for Holidays\nVisited\nOctober 2024\nTraveled\nas a couple\nWritten\nNovember 8, 2024\nHarpreet Singh\nPatiala, India\n11 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nGreat experience!\nWe had a great experience in Kashmir arranged with help of Premiere Tours and travels.

Kashmir has been on our bucket list for a long time. When searching for a tour organizer who can help, I have come across MTB Kashmir. I have spent many hours talking to Sheen Bhai to understand what they do and how they support me. Sheen and the team being cyclists themselves were more convincing for me to go with them because only a cyclist can know better what another cyclist wants from the tour. And also we have added a few trekking days as it is Kashmir. It is our first trekking experience. We did it from Aug 2nd to 10th.\n\nAt the end of the tour, I am happy that, I have taken the right decision to go with MTB Kashmir. I went with lots of apprehensions to Srinagar but then returned back with so much confidence to plan more tours in Kashmir and also got a good friendly team in Kashmir. Their local expertise helped at every stage like taking detours when a road was blocked, providing support despite vehicles blocked and only cyclists allowed on a particular stretch, changing the plan and accommodating our needs when we had to change our trek plan, arranging accommodation with in a day notice, etc. The homestay and the hospitality we got can never be forgotten. The friendly and very affectionate conversation support from Sheen, Arshad, Ajaj, and his entire team is just amazing! 10/10 for the entire team. Before going to the trek, we named our tour \"Jannat e Kashmir\" due to its serene locations but then even our experience was Jannat! And lastly, I must say that the cycles we got were top-notch! We have never experienced such great quality cycles in any another tour cycles provided by other organisers.\nRead more\nReview of:\nMTB Kashmir\nVisited\nAugust 2024\nTraveled\nwith friends\nWritten\nAugust 12, 2024\nFearless53556318043\nGuwahati, India\n2 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nAwesome  and memorable experience\nWe have reached Ardkuwari at 12.45 am and take short rest at shilputri Bhawan dormitory.

It was like a badly organized school picnic rather than a professionally planned trip. The itinerary was dismal, offering little to no sightseeing or meaningful experiences. \n\nOur days were structured in a frustrating manner\u2014waking up at 6 AM, having breakfast at 7 AM, and departing at 8 AM, only to face hours of wasted time without any substantial activities. Clearly that no thought was given to optimizing the schedule or ensuring a smooth & enjoyable experience.\n\nWhat made this even more frustrating was the fact that we paid over 35% more for this package compared to other operators offering similar itineraries. Despite the inflated price, the quality of the hotels selected was shockingly poor & the breakfasts disappointing. Felt like we were getting far less than what we paid for & it was a slap in the face to experience such mediocrity after paying a premium.\n\nThe execution of the tour was appalling. Not only were we subjected to unnecessary travel, but we were also forced to travel over an hour to Indian restaurants, which added no value to the trip & felt like a complete waste of time. It was a constant string of inconveniences and poorly made decisions, all of which contributed to making the experience incredibly frustrating.\n\nA poorly planned & horribly executed trip. SOTC has failed to deliver on its quality. It is clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for this company, and I am deeply dissatisfied with the overall experience. Will never use your services again & will actively discourage anyone I know from doing so.\nRead more\nReview of:\nSOTC for Holidays\nVisited\nDecember 2024\nTraveled\nwith family\nWritten\nJanuary 1, 2025\nSima H\n1 contribution\n5 of 5 bubbles\nGreat tour of Casablanca\nA great tour of Casablanca \nEasy to book, well organised and professional \nI was picked up by my driver Yousef who took me to the start of the tour at Hasan II Mosque .

contribution\n1 of 5 bubbles\nbad experience with SOTC\nI am writing to formally express my deep dissatisfaction with the services provided during the Durga Puja tour to France and Switzerland via SOTC, which took place from 8th to 16th October 2024, originating from Kolkata. We were under the impression that booking through SOTC would ensure a well-managed and enjoyable trip, especially given it was our second international trip with your agency. However, our recent experience was far below acceptable standards, and I feel compelled to escalate this matter for your serious consideration.\n\nHere are the key issues we encountered:\n\nSupport and Guidance During the Tour:\n\nOn the day of visiting the Eiffel Tower, due to a misunderstanding in a heavy rainstorm, we exited through a different gate. When we reached out to our tour manager, Mr. sampat, for assistance, we received inadequate support. Instead of guiding us back, we were instructed to make our own way back to the restaurant, which was both confusing and distressing given the circumstances. The lack of follow-up and his dismissive attitude toward our situation was particularly disheartening. Additionally, his handling of the group's needs, especially regarding the cruise trip and basic amenities like restroom facilities, showed a clear lack of empathy and service orientation.\n\nSince we were completely wet, so opted out of the Cruise trip. We were there for around 2 hours. So my wife, requested for toilet but the tour manager told us that you could go for toilet but bus gate will open only when every member comes back & it was heavily raining. What is this? Completely ruthless behavior. Why is this discrimination against us?\n\nAccommodation:\n\nContrary to the promise of at least 4-star accommodations, the hotels provided (except for Novotel in Zurich) were substandard. The locations, especially in France, were inconveniently far from city centers, making independent exploration impractical. The hotel was far from city ( probably 30 k.m) & since Paris visit was totally spoied by rain, we could not visit any location even at our own cost.\n\nItinerary and Tour Management:\n\nThe choice of places visited in Paris was limited and did not include iconic attractions like the Louvre Museum or the Mona Lisa, essential for a comprehensive experience of Paris. Furthermore, the inflexible schedule, even in adverse weather conditions, and the inability to accommodate reasonable requests like altering of  visiting Disneyland, despite the feasibility observed with on-the-spot ticket purchases, showed a lack of responsiveness. \n\nWe felt abandoned and neglected during what was supposed to be a memorable vacation after paying such a huge price. This experience has not only disappointed us but has also severely impacted our perception of SOTC's commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\nEven after writing this mail to their branch manager ( Kolkata) & even in customer care - nothing happened ( a auto reply mail has come from some Mrs Khan)\n\nDeeply unsatisfied & will consider somebody else next time.\nRead more\nReview of:\nSOTC for Holidays\nVisited\nOctober 2024\nTraveled\nas a couple\nWritten\nNovember 8, 2024\nHarpreet Singh\nPatiala, India\n11 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nGreat experience!\nWe had a great experience in Kashmir arranged with help of Premiere Tours and travels.

Kashmir has been on our bucket list for a long time. When searching for a tour organizer who can help, I have come across MTB Kashmir. I have spent many hours talking to Sheen Bhai to understand what they do and how they support me. Sheen and the team being cyclists themselves were more convincing for me to go with them because only a cyclist can know better what another cyclist wants from the tour. And also we have added a few trekking days as it is Kashmir. It is our first trekking experience. We did it from Aug 2nd to 10th.\n\nAt the end of the tour, I am happy that, I have taken the right decision to go with MTB Kashmir. I went with lots of apprehensions to Srinagar but then returned back with so much confidence to plan more tours in Kashmir and also got a good friendly team in Kashmir. Their local expertise helped at every stage like taking detours when a road was blocked, providing support despite vehicles blocked and only cyclists allowed on a particular stretch, changing the plan and accommodating our needs when we had to change our trek plan, arranging accommodation with in a day notice, etc. The homestay and the hospitality we got can never be forgotten. The friendly and very affectionate conversation support from Sheen, Arshad, Ajaj, and his entire team is just amazing! 10/10 for the entire team. Before going to the trek, we named our tour \"Jannat e Kashmir\" due to its serene locations but then even our experience was Jannat! And lastly, I must say that the cycles we got were top-notch! We have never experienced such great quality cycles in any another tour cycles provided by other organisers.\nRead more\nReview of:\nMTB Kashmir\nVisited\nAugust 2024\nTraveled\nwith friends\nWritten\nAugust 12, 2024\nFearless53556318043\nGuwahati, India\n2 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nAwesome  and memorable experience\nWe have reached Ardkuwari at 12.45 am and take short rest at shilputri Bhawan dormitory.

It was like a badly organized school picnic rather than a professionally planned trip. The itinerary was dismal, offering little to no sightseeing or meaningful experiences. \n\nOur days were structured in a frustrating manner\u2014waking up at 6 AM, having breakfast at 7 AM, and departing at 8 AM, only to face hours of wasted time without any substantial activities. Clearly that no thought was given to optimizing the schedule or ensuring a smooth & enjoyable experience.\n\nWhat made this even more frustrating was the fact that we paid over 35% more for this package compared to other operators offering similar itineraries. Despite the inflated price, the quality of the hotels selected was shockingly poor & the breakfasts disappointing. Felt like we were getting far less than what we paid for & it was a slap in the face to experience such mediocrity after paying a premium.\n\nThe execution of the tour was appalling. Not only were we subjected to unnecessary travel, but we were also forced to travel over an hour to Indian restaurants, which added no value to the trip & felt like a complete waste of time. It was a constant string of inconveniences and poorly made decisions, all of which contributed to making the experience incredibly frustrating.\n\nA poorly planned & horribly executed trip. SOTC has failed to deliver on its quality. It is clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for this company, and I am deeply dissatisfied with the overall experience. Will never use your services again & will actively discourage anyone I know from doing so.\nRead more\nReview of:\nSOTC for Holidays\nVisited\nDecember 2024\nTraveled\nwith family\nWritten\nJanuary 1, 2025\nSima H\n1 contribution\n5 of 5 bubbles\nGreat tour of Casablanca\nA great tour of Casablanca \nEasy to book, well organised and professional \nI was picked up by my driver Yousef who took me to the start of the tour at Hasan II Mosque .

      "content": "29\nAug 2023\nBest places in Kashmir to visit in summer\nby\nSuvendu Rout\n|\nposted in:\nIndia\n,\nNorth India\n|\n6\nNature doesn\u2019t need pen and paper to write poetry, nor does it need words. It writes poetry with landscapes; with flowing rivers and serene lakes; with gorgeous vistas of mountains and valleys. Kashmir is pure, sublime poetry. Its landscape is blessed with high mountains that turn white in winters. On the other hand, it\u2019s resplendent with Chinar trees that turn red and yellow with the coming of autumn. And come summer, the landscape turns lush green. Kashmir is a delight in all seasons. However, here I\u2019m gonna talk about summer only.\nA friend\n(Santosh/ Bablu)\nrecently\nasked me for tips on the best places in Kashmir to visit in summer. So, this piece is dedicated to him.\n\"Agar firdaus bar roo-e zameen ast |\nHameen ast-o, hameen ast-o, hameen ast.\"\n(words in Farsi)\nIn English:\n\"If there is a paradise on earth |\nIt is this, it is this, it is this\u201d\nAmir Khusrau\nIndian scholar, poet,  singer\nYes, Kashmir indeed is heaven on earth. I know it\u2019s cliche, but I can\u2019t help it; this is what comes to my mind first while thinking about Kashmir. I would actually go a step further to say that heaven might actually look like Kashmir, rather than Kashmir resembling heaven. Because Kashmir is for real, while heaven is imaginary! No wonder then that it\u2019s the most sought after natural-destination in India.\nThough Kashmir is an all-season destination, summer is when it receives the most visitors, because it\u2019s the most pleasant during that time.\nWhile writing this article on the best places in Kashmir for summer,\nI draw mostly from experiences of my summer 2017 family trip.\n{More such Himalayan destinations:\nMussoorie\n|||\nDalhousie\n|||\nGreat Himalayan National Park\n}\nKashmir, heaven on earth\nKashmir is indeed heaven on earth\nIf you are a landscape lover, or a nature lover, there is perhaps no better place than Kashmir. From overwhelming heights of the Himalayas to pleasing meadows, from snow-clad white mountain views to lush green hills, from charming lakes to beautiful gardens, it\u2019s a complete paradise.\nApart from Lakshadweep, Kashmir is the only place where Muslims have a majority in India. What this means is that a more than thousand-year old thriving Islamic culture to explore. Their food, clothes, craft, dance, music and language are all very unique partly and partly inspired by the middle-east.\nHowever, in this article, I\u2019m presenting only the natural beauty of Kashmir with a focus on the best places in Kashmir to visit in summer.\n{Read about more destinations in the region:\nLeh- Ladakh\n|||\nVaishno Devi\n}\nIs Kashmir safe for travellers?\nFirst things first. The first question on the mind of first-time travellers to Kashmir is whether Kashmir is safe to travel.\nThough I have forgotten the name of our driver for the trip, I would never forget his words. He said in Hindi mixed with\nKashmiri dialect:\n\u201c\nSaheb, Kashmir se jyada khaetirdari aur mehmannawazi aapko duniya mein kahin nahi milegi\n\u201c, meaning: \u201cSir, you won\u2019t experience better hospitality and warmth\nanywhere in the world\nthan in Kashmir\u201d. He further added, \u201c\nHaan humare masle kai saare hain, par hum apne mehmanon ko isme nahi uljhate hain. Sine pe goli kha lenge, magar apne mehmanon ko kuchh na hone denge\n\u201c, meaning: \u201cYes, we have our issues, but we never bother our guests with any of them. We can take the bullets on our chest rather than harming our guests\u201d.\nHe echoed exactly how we felt while visiting across the state. Everywhere we went, from hotels to shops, from people on the street to officials, everyone was welcoming, and helpful through out. I don\u2019t remember even one unpleasant incident anywhere.\nWhile he shared his anger and disenchantment regarding the political situation in the state (I don\u2019t want to share his specific views here), he was particularly courteous in explaining to us their predicament.\nSpending time with locals | Doodhpathri\nPolitical violence doesn\u2019t affect tourists\nWhile political violence in Kashmir\nhas a long history, one would rarely hear about violence against or involving tourists. There are two main reasons for this. First, Kashmiris in general (and people of hills all over) are naturally warm and lovable; they take their hospitality very seriously. Two, economy of Kashmir heavily depends on tourism.\nSo, they take special care that tourists have a safe time there.\nSo, tourists are safe and happy in Kashmir. No need to worry. Just keep normal precautions like one would generally keep while travelling anywhere else. Keep your eyes and ears open. Don\u2019t argue with people, especially avoid political arguments. Yes, you may try to listen to them, and their side of the story, and do respect their views. It actually helps. Moreover, it can actually change your perspective.\nA summer experiencing the best places in Kashmir\nIn my younger days, I have heard my mom say many a times that she wanted to visit Kashmir at least once in life. At last, she had the opportunity of visiting her dream destination. In fact, Kashmir perhaps is a dream destination for all Indians.\nIn the summer of 2017, we decided to visit Kashmir for the first time along with the family of a childhood friend. We were seven of us: I, Parina and maa (mom), and four of my friend\u2019s family- Asha, Manas and their two kids. It was a five-day trip covering five places: Srinagar, Pahalgam, Gulmarg, Sonmarg and Doodhpathri.\nDal Lake with the Himalayas\nFive Best Places in Kashmir to visit in summer\nKashmir is beautiful through out the year. It\u2019s pleasant in summers, and bone chilling cold in the winters. However, a lot of people visit there in the winter for snow-sports and enjoying the views of white mountainous landscape. In this article though, I\u2019m going to share my experiences of the best places in Kashmir to visit in summer.\nEvery inch of Kashmir is so beautiful that I find it difficult to pick the best places in Kashmir. So, it\u2019s only for a practical travel-planning purpose that I\u2019m sharing my experiences of the five best places in Kashmir. Each of these five places is different from the other with a special character of its own.\nWhile Srinagar is the capital city and is especially famous for its iconic Dal lake, Gulmarg is a great place for snow-experience. Pahalgam has the best meadows and valley views. If you want to feel a glacier under your feet, Sonmarg is the place for you. Last but not the least, if you want peaceful idyllic charm of a river flowing in a valley, Doodhpathri is the best place.\nThere are quite a few other wonderful places in Kashmir, but for a first-timer, especially in summer, these are the best places to choose.\nIf you want to have a plan:\nIn case you are a first time traveller, and a five day trip makes sense for you, here\u2019s a suggestive plan:\nDay-1:\nArrive in Srinagar, check in; explore the iconic gardens; evening at\nDal lake\nDay-2:\nPre-lunch: local Srinagar (gardens and mosques); post-lunch: Doodhpathri\nDay-3:\nPahalgam; pony ride to Baisaran valley\nDay-4:\nVisit Gulmarg, take the gondola ride, relax on the meadows\nDay-5:\nVisit Sonmarg, relax on the meadows; hike up to Thajiwas glacier.\nFor your planning convenience, here\u2019s an indicative map marked with the best places in Kashmir to visit in the summer.\nKashmir Tourist Map | Source: Googlemaps\nSrinagar\nWithout shadow of a doubt, Srinagar is the most beautiful city in India, and one of the best places in Kashmir to visit any time of the year. The capital city offers the most number of things to do. However, the three quintessential things that Srinagar is known for are the picturesque Dal Lake, the iconic gardens and its beautiful mosques.\nNot to forget the rich history and cultural heritage of the city as well. Established at least 1500 years ago, the city has passed through a number of distinct cultural phases, and still retains some of those characters. I park the idea of a detailed presentation of the city for a later article. Here I\u2019m just giving a snapshot of the best places/ experiences not to miss.\nShikara ride in Dal Lake:\nI always love a boat ride in the calm waters of a lake. From the backwaters of Alleppey to the lake city\nUdaipur\n(click) and the hill station of\nNainital\n(click),\u00a0lakes are at the center of all tourist attractions. Dal lake is no exception. But for me, the charm of a shikara (small boat) ride in Dal lake is unmatchable.\nShikara ride in Dal lake\nWith the great Himalayas in the backdrop, the calm blue waters of the lake make for a spectacular sight. The colourful shikars took us around the lake, first to a peaceful part, and then through the floating markets of Dal lake. I found the shikara-vendors selling\nkahwa\n(a Kashmiri hot beverage), and other craft products to be a very interesting sight. However, riding a boat through the floating shops\nmostly\nselling Kashmiri hand-made textile products was absolutely fascinating.\nAnother memorable experience at the lake was visiting the Gulshan Book-Cafe. Do ask your shikara rider for the cafe and spend an hour there.\nPassing through the floating market\nHouseboats of Dal Lake:\nThough people call them houseboats, I prefer calling them boat-houses as they are not boats in real meaning of the term. Unlike boats, they don\u2019t really float around the lake; they float, but are stuck to the ground on the bank of the lake. They are bigger than the houseboats of\nAlleppey in Kerala\n, and give an experience of a resort.\nThough we didn\u2019t have the opportunity of staying in the houseboats, I\u2019m sure that watching sunrises and sunsets must be special experiences from those houseboats. Moreover, they look fascinating enough from within the lake to go around them.\nHouseboats | Dal Lake\nGardens of Srinagar:\nSrinagar has to be the city with maximum number of beautiful gardens in India.\u00a0 Though Bangalore,\nOoty\n, Kodaikanal and\nDelhi\nwould give it a stiff competition, still Srinagar would win it hands down! In fact, t\nhe gardens of Srinagar are easily comparable to and often better than those in Europe (see:\nParis\n|||\nGeneva\n|||\nAmsterdam\n).\nAmong the most beautiful gardens in Srinagar, the three Mughal Gardens come to my mind first:\nNishat Bagh\n|\nShalimar Bagh | Chasme Shahi Garden\n. Nishat Bagh is the largest one, and the most impressive. Situated on the foothills of Zabarwan mountains (part of Pir Panjal range of Himalayas) on one side, and Dal lake on the other, one cannot ask for better views! The terraced garden is a feast to the eyes with hundreds of varieties of flowers, and the magnificent Chinar trees (that resemble maple trees). It has been enchanting the visitors since 1633!\nView of Dal lake from Pari Mahal\nApart from the Mughal Gardens, the other must-visit gardens are:\nPari Mahal\n|\nIndira Gandhi Tulip Garden\n(Asia\u2019s largest tulip garden) |\nNehru Memorial Botanical Garden | Harwan Garden | Naseem Bagh, in descending order of my favorites list.\nFor want of time, if you want to prioritize, at least visit the ones in bold letters above. Pari Mahal gives the best panoramic view of the Dal lake.\nPlease note that the Tulip garden opens only from end-March to April, the spring-summer season.\nPopular Muslim shrines in Srinagar:\nIrrespective of whether you want to visit the shrines of Srinagar for reasons of faith or not, they are absolutely worth visiting for their architectural beauty. The two most important Muslim shrines in Srinagar are the Hazratbal Shrine and the Jamia Masjid.\nHazratbal Shrine\nHazratbal shrine:\nBuilt in the 17th century, this is one of the most important Muslim shrines in India as it hosts strands of hair of the Prophet Muhammed himself! The shrine, also known as Dargah Sharif, is as much popular among locals as among travellers. It has a long and quite\ninteresting history\n(click to read).\nFor a long time, it has been a symbol of Kashmir\u2019s communal harmony.\nWe spent an evening at the shrine and loved the experience. From the shrine\u2019s campus, the panoramic view of the lake with a backdrop of the mountains was quite a spectacle. We sat there at the steps leading to the lake for more than an hour.\nJamia Masjid:\nThe most important mosque in Srinagar, Jamia\nMasjid\nwas first built in 1402. Afterwards, it was rebuilt by the Mughals. I loved its architecture especially because of its novelty. Instead of the regular dome structure, it has a pyramidal shape, mostly inspired by Persian architectural style, with some resemblance with Buddhist Pagodas.\nEnamored by its unique design (by seeing in pictures), I had decided to definitely visit this mosque. On the last day of our trip, while coming back from Sonmarg to catch our flight, we were actually running a little late. Still then, I requested our driver to make a quick stop at the mosque.\nIn spite of suffering severe damages due to major fires three times in its history, it still dazzles as ever, and can host up to 33000 worshippers at a time.\nJamia Mosque, Srinagar\nDoodhpathri\nFor me, the second in the list of best places to visit in Kashmir in summer is Doodhpathri (literally: milky-rock). Though many visitors give it a miss, we made it a point to spend a good part of a day here. In fact, not having a large crowd was a major reason for enjoying the views and tranquility even more. Could you believe, i\nt\u2019s just about 45 kms from Srinagar, but still is a hidden gem!\nWe loved its enchanting meadows and the valley with river Shaliganga flowing through milky white rock beds.\nThe valley has two major points of attraction: the meadows and the river valley.\nDoodhpathri Valley\nFirst we headed to the river point where we crossed over to the other side over a small wooden bridge. Indeed, true to its name the rock bed looked milky white, and the water too looked white! Shaliganga river flowing through the pine forests over the white rock bed made for a painting-like scenery.\nWhile coming back, we stopped over at the meadows. What a pleasant sight that was! With very few tourists around, we went up to a picnicking local family to strike a nice chat. I loved having conversation with a local shepherd who was attending to his sheep grazing at the meadow. Whenever next time I\u2019m in Srinagar, I\u2019ll try to revisit this charming place.\nA shepherd | Doodhpathri\nPahalgam\nPahalgam (90 kms from Srinagar) is famous for its stunning valleys like Betaab valley, Aru valley and Baisaran valley. On reaching Pahalgam, we realized that not all the valley are reachable by car. From Pahalgam, there are two routes. While one goes towards Betaab valley and Chandanwadi, the other takes you to Aru valley and Lidder river valley. One of Kashmir\u2019s most beautiful treks, the\nTarsar-Marsar lake trek\nbegins from Aru.\n{Similar reading suggestion:\nCamping in Zanskar- Ladakh\n|||\nTriund Trekking\n}\nHowever, to reach the most stunning beauty of them all- the Baisaran valley, one must take a pony ride. On that ride only, they take you to a few more view points like Dabyan, Deno valley and Kashmir valley.\nBaisaran Valley, a hidden gem\nWe took that difficult pony ride across the hills to the Baisaran valley, which people fondly call \u2018Mini Switzerland\u2019. It was raining a bit before we reached Pahalgam. So, the narrow pathway up the hill was slippery, which made the ride even more difficult. However, it was okay, as even my mom could take the ride. In fact, she enjoyed the challenge of that trecherous ride. As they say, the best views come after the hardest journey.\nOnce we reached the Baisaran valley, one view of the hidden meadow, and all our pain was gone! It was a stunning sight with snow-capped mountains (Pir Panjal range) and deep green pine forests surrounding the valley. We spent more than half a day there walking around the lush green grounds and taking pictures with rabbits and pigeons.\nPahalgam undoubtedly, has to be there in the top five best places in Kashmir to visit in the summer.\nParina enjoying with the pigeons\nGulmarg\nNext on the list of best places to visit in Kashmir in summer has to be Gulmarg, 50 kms away from Srinagar.\nIt offers the best winter sports avenues in India. However, w\ninter is a difficult time for me to tolerate the chilling cold. So, even t\nhough Gulmarg is a round-the-year destination, I prefer the summer.\nIn summer, one can take the gondola (cable car) ride up to the snow point, and enjoy some skiing as well. Moreover, the large meadow with a small hill, atop which there is a small Shiva temple makes for a gorgeous sight. From near this central meadow, one has to take the gondola.\nAll of us in Gulmarg\nThe Gondola ride:\nFor us, the most awaited activity of the trip was taking this gondola ride.\nWe reached there late in the morning, and took the gondola right away to the snow point. We had to wear those long boots and extra-jackets that we got from a vendor. However, I don\u2019t think it was really necessary. Maybe the boot was a bit helpful, but the jacket was not required (the normal jacket that we were wearing, would have been enough).\nThe view from the gondola was wonderful, and the ride was exciting, to say the least. At the top, walking over the snow, the smile on the face of my mother was very special to me. She was so happy! Parina did some skiing, but I don\u2019t like trying out these things for 30 minutes!\nThe gondola ride has two phases. We rode up to phase-1 only. From the end of phase-2, one can trek up to (5 kms) the Alpather lake, beyond which is the Apharwat peak.\nOnce back to the central meadows, we took a pony ride around the meadow. The snow-clad mountains overlooking the green meadow was a stunning sight! There is a small market near the meadows, where we had our modest lunch, and left for Srinagar to reach before the evening.\nParina trying skiing | Gulmarg\nThings to do in Gulmarg:\nGondola ride to snow point; enjoy snow sports up there\nWalk around the central meadow and hike up to the Shiva temple\nTrekking to Alpather lake; the lake remains partially frozen even in the summer. Alternately, one can take a pony ride, or gondola ride to reach there.\nRide a pony up to Khilanmarg (only 5 kms away)\nPlay golf at the golf course just on the outskirts of Gulmarg\nSonmarg\nLast but not the least, Sonmarg has to be there on the list of best places in Kashmir to visit in summer. We visited this gorgeous valley on the last day of our trip. It\u2019s about 90 kms from Srinagar, and takes about 2 hrs to reach.\nWhen we drove up to Sonmarg in May, the roads were cut through thick layers of snow! So, the route doesn\u2019t open till late April or May; and they close in late October.\nSince this route goes towards Ladakh,\u00a0the view of snow-clad mountains gets more frequent on this route. All over the route, the sight of small streams formed out of the glaciers, flowing between two mountains makes the route picture perfect!\nSonmarg is famous for the lakes and the treks. We were a big group with my mom being part of it. So, trekking was out of question. However, we did hike up to the Thajiwas glacier (9186 ft), the origin of Sind river. Standing on the awe-inspiring glacier was an amazing experience.\nIf you have time, you may explore the nearby areas of Baltal valley and Zoji La pass. Sonmarg is especially popular among trekkers in the summer for it offers some of the most amazing trek routes in India.\nTreks in Sonmarg:\nKashmir Great Lakes Trek:\nSonmarg is the base location for this famous, but difficult trek. The lakes on the trek (in sequence) are:\nVishansar lake \u2013\nKrishansar lake \u2013\nGadsar lake \u2013\nSatsar lake \u2013\nGangabal lake \u2013\nNandkol lake. Read a useful article on the\ndetailed trek route\n.\nOther major treks: Amarnath peak | Machoi peak | Sirbal peak | Kalahoi peak.\nPainting-like landscape | Sonmarg\nBeyond the best places in Kashmir\nOf course, there are some more wonderful destinations in Kashmir beyond my list of best places in Kashmir to visit in the summer.\nGurez Valley:\nKishanganga river | Wular lake | Razdan pass | Dawar swamp | Habba Khatoon peak\nYusmarg:\nIt\u2019s believed that Jesus visited this valley. Major attractions: Sang-e-safed (white rocks) | Pakharpora shrine | Nilang lake\nPulwama:\nTarsar- Marsar lake | Aharbal falls | Avantishwar temple.\nAnantnag:\nMartand sun temple | Jhelum river.\nBest Places in Kashmir: Travel Tips\nBest time to visit:\nFor pleasant weather: April to September (though roads to northern Kashmir open only in May)\nFor winter sports/ snow view: December to March.\nHow to reach:\nThe best way is to reach Srinagar by air\nNearest railway station, Udhampur is more than 200 kms away! Jammu Tawi (270 kms) is also an important station\nRegular bus services from Jammu, Delhi and Chandigarh.\nWhere to stay in Srinagar:\nSome budget hotels:\nDal View Resort | Aala Residency | Nishat View | Curio\u2019s All Seasons | Grand Habib | Pacific | Green Ville | Al Mehar\nBudget Houseboats:\nYoung Manhattan | Young Goodluck | Jewel In the Crown | New Golden Lily\nHostels:\nUrban Den | GoStops | Zostel | Orania | Gypsys Homestay.\nThe guesthouse | Kashmir University\nHow to move around:\nIf you have enough time, you may take local buses\nIn case time is short on hand, cabs/ taxis are the best way to move around\nWhere to eat in Srinagar:\nGolden Chinar | Kullad Chai | Gulshan cafe | Tao restaurant & cafe | Cafe Liberty | Lhasa restaurant | Chaai Jaai | Books & Bricks | Winterfell cafe | Goodfellas cafe | 14th Avenue.\nMust try food: Kashmiri Dum Aloo, Rogan Josh, Goshtaba, Kahwa, Yakhni, Noon Chai\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019ts:\nFirst check\nsafety tips\nfrom the J&K police\nCarry your documents- identity cards, address proof, etc.\nKeep the phone always with location feature turned on\nDon\u2019t start discussing politics; even if it starts somehow, don\u2019t argue with them\nCarry your woolens, even in the summer\nAlso carry your rain jacket and umbrella; it can rain in the summers\nHaving good quality shoes for rough terrains is a good idea\nBe ready to live without phone for a while, if network issues arise.\nConcluding thoughts on the best places in Kashmir\nOne cannot \u2018experience\u2019 all that Kashmir has to offer in five days. But our trip had a bit of everything: from boat rides to gondola rides, from romancing the tranquil waters of the lake to encountering the snowy mountains, we had it all. Whenever people have asked me about my favorite landscape experience, Kashmir has always sprung up in my mind first. It\u2019s just picture perfect. Even if you take a picture with your eyes closed, you won\u2019t be disappointed with the output.\nHowever, I remember Kashmir not only for its natural beauty.\nIt was not only rejuvenating for the battered soul, but also enriching for the hungry mind. I always wanted to experience that mystical land that is heaven on one hand and the center of many a controversies/ conflicts on the other. I haven\u2019t shared much of my interactions with the locals and their viewpoints for obvious reasons. But those conversations were indeed an eye-opener.\nI hope this piece on the best places in Kashmir to visit in the summer is enjoyable for your reading, and is also helpful for your planning. Or, you can always write to us for more details.\nRelated",

contribution\n1 of 5 bubbles\nbad experience with SOTC\nI am writing to formally express my deep dissatisfaction with the services provided during the Durga Puja tour to France and Switzerland via SOTC, which took place from 8th to 16th October 2024, originating from Kolkata. We were under the impression that booking through SOTC would ensure a well-managed and enjoyable trip, especially given it was our second international trip with your agency. However, our recent experience was far below acceptable standards, and I feel compelled to escalate this matter for your serious consideration.\n\nHere are the key issues we encountered:\n\nSupport and Guidance During the Tour:\n\nOn the day of visiting the Eiffel Tower, due to a misunderstanding in a heavy rainstorm, we exited through a different gate. When we reached out to our tour manager, Mr. sampat, for assistance, we received inadequate support. Instead of guiding us back, we were instructed to make our own way back to the restaurant, which was both confusing and distressing given the circumstances. The lack of follow-up and his dismissive attitude toward our situation was particularly disheartening. Additionally, his handling of the group's needs, especially regarding the cruise trip and basic amenities like restroom facilities, showed a clear lack of empathy and service orientation.\n\nSince we were completely wet, so opted out of the Cruise trip. We were there for around 2 hours. So my wife, requested for toilet but the tour manager told us that you could go for toilet but bus gate will open only when every member comes back & it was heavily raining. What is this? Completely ruthless behavior. Why is this discrimination against us?\n\nAccommodation:\n\nContrary to the promise of at least 4-star accommodations, the hotels provided (except for Novotel in Zurich) were substandard. The locations, especially in France, were inconveniently far from city centers, making independent exploration impractical. The hotel was far from city ( probably 30 k.m) & since Paris visit was totally spoied by rain, we could not visit any location even at our own cost.\n\nItinerary and Tour Management:\n\nThe choice of places visited in Paris was limited and did not include iconic attractions like the Louvre Museum or the Mona Lisa, essential for a comprehensive experience of Paris. Furthermore, the inflexible schedule, even in adverse weather conditions, and the inability to accommodate reasonable requests like altering of  visiting Disneyland, despite the feasibility observed with on-the-spot ticket purchases, showed a lack of responsiveness. \n\nWe felt abandoned and neglected during what was supposed to be a memorable vacation after paying such a huge price. This experience has not only disappointed us but has also severely impacted our perception of SOTC's commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\nEven after writing this mail to their branch manager ( Kolkata) & even in customer care - nothing happened ( a auto reply mail has come from some Mrs Khan)\n\nDeeply unsatisfied & will consider somebody else next time.\nRead more\nReview of:\nSOTC for Holidays\nVisited\nOctober 2024\nTraveled\nas a couple\nWritten\nNovember 8, 2024\nHarpreet Singh\nPatiala, India\n11 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nGreat experience!\nWe had a great experience in Kashmir arranged with help of Premiere Tours and travels. Mr. Auyub is a very professional guy and he took utmost care that our stay and travel was comfortable.\nMuzaffar was our tour guide and he drove us to several places throughout our week trip.

Kashmir has been on our bucket list for a long time. When searching for a tour organizer who can help, I have come across MTB Kashmir. I have spent many hours talking to Sheen Bhai to understand what they do and how they support me. Sheen and the team being cyclists themselves were more convincing for me to go with them because only a cyclist can know better what another cyclist wants from the tour. And also we have added a few trekking days as it is Kashmir. It is our first trekking experience. We did it from Aug 2nd to 10th.\n\nAt the end of the tour, I am happy that, I have taken the right decision to go with MTB Kashmir. I went with lots of apprehensions to Srinagar but then returned back with so much confidence to plan more tours in Kashmir and also got a good friendly team in Kashmir. Their local expertise helped at every stage like taking detours when a road was blocked, providing support despite vehicles blocked and only cyclists allowed on a particular stretch, changing the plan and accommodating our needs when we had to change our trek plan, arranging accommodation with in a day notice, etc. The homestay and the hospitality we got can never be forgotten. The friendly and very affectionate conversation support from Sheen, Arshad, Ajaj, and his entire team is just amazing! 10/10 for the entire team. Before going to the trek, we named our tour \"Jannat e Kashmir\" due to its serene locations but then even our experience was Jannat! And lastly, I must say that the cycles we got were top-notch! We have never experienced such great quality cycles in any another tour cycles provided by other organisers.\nRead more\nReview of:\nMTB Kashmir\nVisited\nAugust 2024\nTraveled\nwith friends\nWritten\nAugust 12, 2024\nFearless53556318043\nGuwahati, India\n2 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nAwesome  and memorable experience\nWe have reached Ardkuwari at 12.45 am and take short rest at shilputri Bhawan dormitory.

It was like a badly organized school picnic rather than a professionally planned trip. The itinerary was dismal, offering little to no sightseeing or meaningful experiences. \n\nOur days were structured in a frustrating manner\u2014waking up at 6 AM, having breakfast at 7 AM, and departing at 8 AM, only to face hours of wasted time without any substantial activities. Clearly that no thought was given to optimizing the schedule or ensuring a smooth & enjoyable experience.\n\nWhat made this even more frustrating was the fact that we paid over 35% more for this package compared to other operators offering similar itineraries. Despite the inflated price, the quality of the hotels selected was shockingly poor & the breakfasts disappointing. Felt like we were getting far less than what we paid for & it was a slap in the face to experience such mediocrity after paying a premium.\n\nThe execution of the tour was appalling. Not only were we subjected to unnecessary travel, but we were also forced to travel over an hour to Indian restaurants, which added no value to the trip & felt like a complete waste of time. It was a constant string of inconveniences and poorly made decisions, all of which contributed to making the experience incredibly frustrating.\n\nA poorly planned & horribly executed trip. SOTC has failed to deliver on its quality. It is clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for this company, and I am deeply dissatisfied with the overall experience. Will never use your services again & will actively discourage anyone I know from doing so.\nRead more\nReview of:\nSOTC for Holidays\nVisited\nDecember 2024\nTraveled\nwith family\nWritten\nJanuary 1, 2025\nSima H\n1 contribution\n5 of 5 bubbles\nGreat tour of Casablanca\nA great tour of Casablanca \nEasy to book, well organised and professional \nI was picked up by my driver Yousef who took me to the start of the tour at Hasan II Mosque .

contribution\n1 of 5 bubbles\nbad experience with SOTC\nI am writing to formally express my deep dissatisfaction with the services provided during the Durga Puja tour to France and Switzerland via SOTC, which took place from 8th to 16th October 2024, originating from Kolkata. We were under the impression that booking through SOTC would ensure a well-managed and enjoyable trip, especially given it was our second international trip with your agency. However, our recent experience was far below acceptable standards, and I feel compelled to escalate this matter for your serious consideration.\n\nHere are the key issues we encountered:\n\nSupport and Guidance During the Tour:\n\nOn the day of visiting the Eiffel Tower, due to a misunderstanding in a heavy rainstorm, we exited through a different gate. When we reached out to our tour manager, Mr. sampat, for assistance, we received inadequate support. Instead of guiding us back, we were instructed to make our own way back to the restaurant, which was both confusing and distressing given the circumstances. The lack of follow-up and his dismissive attitude toward our situation was particularly disheartening. Additionally, his handling of the group's needs, especially regarding the cruise trip and basic amenities like restroom facilities, showed a clear lack of empathy and service orientation.\n\nSince we were completely wet, so opted out of the Cruise trip. We were there for around 2 hours. So my wife, requested for toilet but the tour manager told us that you could go for toilet but bus gate will open only when every member comes back & it was heavily raining. What is this? Completely ruthless behavior. Why is this discrimination against us?\n\nAccommodation:\n\nContrary to the promise of at least 4-star accommodations, the hotels provided (except for Novotel in Zurich) were substandard. The locations, especially in France, were inconveniently far from city centers, making independent exploration impractical. The hotel was far from city ( probably 30 k.m) & since Paris visit was totally spoied by rain, we could not visit any location even at our own cost.\n\nItinerary and Tour Management:\n\nThe choice of places visited in Paris was limited and did not include iconic attractions like the Louvre Museum or the Mona Lisa, essential for a comprehensive experience of Paris. Furthermore, the inflexible schedule, even in adverse weather conditions, and the inability to accommodate reasonable requests like altering of  visiting Disneyland, despite the feasibility observed with on-the-spot ticket purchases, showed a lack of responsiveness. \n\nWe felt abandoned and neglected during what was supposed to be a memorable vacation after paying such a huge price. This experience has not only disappointed us but has also severely impacted our perception of SOTC's commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\nEven after writing this mail to their branch manager ( Kolkata) & even in customer care - nothing happened ( a auto reply mail has come from some Mrs Khan)\n\nDeeply unsatisfied & will consider somebody else next time.\nRead more\nReview of:\nSOTC for Holidays\nVisited\nOctober 2024\nTraveled\nas a couple\nWritten\nNovember 8, 2024\nHarpreet Singh\nPatiala, India\n11 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nGreat experience!\nWe had a great experience in Kashmir arranged with help of Premiere Tours and travels.

Kashmir has been on our bucket list for a long time. When searching for a tour organizer who can help, I have come across MTB Kashmir. I have spent many hours talking to Sheen Bhai to understand what they do and how they support me. Sheen and the team being cyclists themselves were more convincing for me to go with them because only a cyclist can know better what another cyclist wants from the tour. And also we have added a few trekking days as it is Kashmir. It is our first trekking experience. We did it from Aug 2nd to 10th.\n\nAt the end of the tour, I am happy that, I have taken the right decision to go with MTB Kashmir. I went with lots of apprehensions to Srinagar but then returned back with so much confidence to plan more tours in Kashmir and also got a good friendly team in Kashmir. Their local expertise helped at every stage like taking detours when a road was blocked, providing support despite vehicles blocked and only cyclists allowed on a particular stretch, changing the plan and accommodating our needs when we had to change our trek plan, arranging accommodation with in a day notice, etc. The homestay and the hospitality we got can never be forgotten. The friendly and very affectionate conversation support from Sheen, Arshad, Ajaj, and his entire team is just amazing! 10/10 for the entire team. Before going to the trek, we named our tour \"Jannat e Kashmir\" due to its serene locations but then even our experience was Jannat! And lastly, I must say that the cycles we got were top-notch! We have never experienced such great quality cycles in any another tour cycles provided by other organisers.\nRead more\nReview of:\nMTB Kashmir\nVisited\nAugust 2024\nTraveled\nwith friends\nWritten\nAugust 12, 2024\nFearless53556318043\nGuwahati, India\n2 contributions\n5 of 5 bubbles\nAwesome  and memorable experience\nWe have reached Ardkuwari at 12.45 am and take short rest at shilputri Bhawan dormitory.

It was like a badly organized school picnic rather than a professionally planned trip. The itinerary was dismal, offering little to no sightseeing or meaningful experiences. \n\nOur days were structured in a frustrating manner\u2014waking up at 6 AM, having breakfast at 7 AM, and departing at 8 AM, only to face hours of wasted time without any substantial activities. Clearly that no thought was given to optimizing the schedule or ensuring a smooth & enjoyable experience.\n\nWhat made this even more frustrating was the fact that we paid over 35% more for this package compared to other operators offering similar itineraries. Despite the inflated price, the quality of the hotels selected was shockingly poor & the breakfasts disappointing. Felt like we were getting far less than what we paid for & it was a slap in the face to experience such mediocrity after paying a premium.\n\nThe execution of the tour was appalling. Not only were we subjected to unnecessary travel, but we were also forced to travel over an hour to Indian restaurants, which added no value to the trip & felt like a complete waste of time. It was a constant string of inconveniences and poorly made decisions, all of which contributed to making the experience incredibly frustrating.\n\nA poorly planned & horribly executed trip. SOTC has failed to deliver on its quality. It is clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for this company, and I am deeply dissatisfied with the overall experience. Will never use your services again & will actively discourage anyone I know from doing so.\nRead more\nReview of:\nSOTC for Holidays\nVisited\nDecember 2024\nTraveled\nwith family\nWritten\nJanuary 1, 2025\nSima H\n1 contribution\n5 of 5 bubbles\nGreat tour of Casablanca\nA great tour of Casablanca \nEasy to book, well organised and professional \nI was picked up by my driver Yousef who took me to the start of the tour at Hasan II Mosque .

      "content": "29\nAug 2023\nBest places in Kashmir to visit in summer\nby\nSuvendu Rout\n|\nposted in:\nIndia\n,\nNorth India\n|\n6\nNature doesn\u2019t need pen and paper to write poetry, nor does it need words. It writes poetry with landscapes; with flowing rivers and serene lakes; with gorgeous vistas of mountains and valleys. Kashmir is pure, sublime poetry. Its landscape is blessed with high mountains that turn white in winters. On the other hand, it\u2019s resplendent with Chinar trees that turn red and yellow with the coming of autumn. And come summer, the landscape turns lush green. Kashmir is a delight in all seasons. However, here I\u2019m gonna talk about summer only.\nA friend\n(Santosh/ Bablu)\nrecently\nasked me for tips on the best places in Kashmir to visit in summer. So, this piece is dedicated to him.\n\"Agar firdaus bar roo-e zameen ast |\nHameen ast-o, hameen ast-o, hameen ast.\"\n(words in Farsi)\nIn English:\n\"If there is a paradise on earth |\nIt is this, it is this, it is this\u201d\nAmir Khusrau\nIndian scholar, poet,  singer\nYes, Kashmir indeed is heaven on earth. I know it\u2019s cliche, but I can\u2019t help it; this is what comes to my mind first while thinking about Kashmir. I would actually go a step further to say that heaven might actually look like Kashmir, rather than Kashmir resembling heaven. Because Kashmir is for real, while heaven is imaginary! No wonder then that it\u2019s the most sought after natural-destination in India.\nThough Kashmir is an all-season destination, summer is when it receives the most visitors, because it\u2019s the most pleasant during that time.\nWhile writing this article on the best places in Kashmir for summer,\nI draw mostly from experiences of my summer 2017 family trip.\n{More such Himalayan destinations:\nMussoorie\n|||\nDalhousie\n|||\nGreat Himalayan National Park\n}\nKashmir, heaven on earth\nKashmir is indeed heaven on earth\nIf you are a landscape lover, or a nature lover, there is perhaps no better place than Kashmir. From overwhelming heights of the Himalayas to pleasing meadows, from snow-clad white mountain views to lush green hills, from charming lakes to beautiful gardens, it\u2019s a complete paradise.\nApart from Lakshadweep, Kashmir is the only place where Muslims have a majority in India. What this means is that a more than thousand-year old thriving Islamic culture to explore. Their food, clothes, craft, dance, music and language are all very unique partly and partly inspired by the middle-east.\nHowever, in this article, I\u2019m presenting only the natural beauty of Kashmir with a focus on the best places in Kashmir to visit in summer.\n{Read about more destinations in the region:\nLeh- Ladakh\n|||\nVaishno Devi\n}\nIs Kashmir safe for travellers?\nFirst things first. The first question on the mind of first-time travellers to Kashmir is whether Kashmir is safe to travel.\nThough I have forgotten the name of our driver for the trip, I would never forget his words. He said in Hindi mixed with\nKashmiri dialect:\n\u201c\nSaheb, Kashmir se jyada khaetirdari aur mehmannawazi aapko duniya mein kahin nahi milegi\n\u201c, meaning: \u201cSir, you won\u2019t experience better hospitality and warmth\nanywhere in the world\nthan in Kashmir\u201d. He further added, \u201c\nHaan humare masle kai saare hain, par hum apne mehmanon ko isme nahi uljhate hain. Sine pe goli kha lenge, magar apne mehmanon ko kuchh na hone denge\n\u201c, meaning: \u201cYes, we have our issues, but we never bother our guests with any of them. We can take the bullets on our chest rather than harming our guests\u201d.\nHe echoed exactly how we felt while visiting across the state. Everywhere we went, from hotels to shops, from people on the street to officials, everyone was welcoming, and helpful through out. I don\u2019t remember even one unpleasant incident anywhere.\nWhile he shared his anger and disenchantment regarding the political situation in the state (I don\u2019t want to share his specific views here), he was particularly courteous in explaining to us their predicament.\nSpending time with locals | Doodhpathri\nPolitical violence doesn\u2019t affect tourists\nWhile political violence in Kashmir\nhas a long history, one would rarely hear about violence against or involving tourists. There are two main reasons for this. First, Kashmiris in general (and people of hills all over) are naturally warm and lovable; they take their hospitality very seriously. Two, economy of Kashmir heavily depends on tourism.\nSo, they take special care that tourists have a safe time there.\nSo, tourists are safe and happy in Kashmir. No need to worry. Just keep normal precautions like one would generally keep while travelling anywhere else. Keep your eyes and ears open. Don\u2019t argue with people, especially avoid political arguments. Yes, you may try to listen to them, and their side of the story, and do respect their views. It actually helps. Moreover, it can actually change your perspective.\nA summer experiencing the best places in Kashmir\nIn my younger days, I have heard my mom say many a times that she wanted to visit Kashmir at least once in life. At last, she had the opportunity of visiting her dream destination. In fact, Kashmir perhaps is a dream destination for all Indians.\nIn the summer of 2017, we decided to visit Kashmir for the first time along with the family of a childhood friend. We were seven of us: I, Parina and maa (mom), and four of my friend\u2019s family- Asha, Manas and their two kids. It was a five-day trip covering five places: Srinagar, Pahalgam, Gulmarg, Sonmarg and Doodhpathri.\nDal Lake with the Himalayas\nFive Best Places in Kashmir to visit in summer\nKashmir is beautiful through out the year. It\u2019s pleasant in summers, and bone chilling cold in the winters. However, a lot of people visit there in the winter for snow-sports and enjoying the views of white mountainous landscape. In this article though, I\u2019m going to share my experiences of the best places in Kashmir to visit in summer.\nEvery inch of Kashmir is so beautiful that I find it difficult to pick the best places in Kashmir. So, it\u2019s only for a practical travel-planning purpose that I\u2019m sharing my experiences of the five best places in Kashmir. Each of these five places is different from the other with a special character of its own.\nWhile Srinagar is the capital city and is especially famous for its iconic Dal lake, Gulmarg is a great place for snow-experience. Pahalgam has the best meadows and valley views. If you want to feel a glacier under your feet, Sonmarg is the place for you. Last but not the least, if you want peaceful idyllic charm of a river flowing in a valley, Doodhpathri is the best place.\nThere are quite a few other wonderful places in Kashmir, but for a first-timer, especially in summer, these are the best places to choose.\nIf you want to have a plan:\nIn case you are a first time traveller, and a five day trip makes sense for you, here\u2019s a suggestive plan:\nDay-1:\nArrive in Srinagar, check in; explore the iconic gardens; evening at\nDal lake\nDay-2:\nPre-lunch: local Srinagar (gardens and mosques); post-lunch: Doodhpathri\nDay-3:\nPahalgam; pony ride to Baisaran valley\nDay-4:\nVisit Gulmarg, take the gondola ride, relax on the meadows\nDay-5:\nVisit Sonmarg, relax on the meadows; hike up to Thajiwas glacier.\nFor your planning convenience, here\u2019s an indicative map marked with the best places in Kashmir to visit in the summer.\nKashmir Tourist Map | Source: Googlemaps\nSrinagar\nWithout shadow of a doubt, Srinagar is the most beautiful city in India, and one of the best places in Kashmir to visit any time of the year. The capital city offers the most number of things to do. However, the three quintessential things that Srinagar is known for are the picturesque Dal Lake, the iconic gardens and its beautiful mosques.\nNot to forget the rich history and cultural heritage of the city as well. Established at least 1500 years ago, the city has passed through a number of distinct cultural phases, and still retains some of those characters. I park the idea of a detailed presentation of the city for a later article. Here I\u2019m just giving a snapshot of the best places/ experiences not to miss.\nShikara ride in Dal Lake:\nI always love a boat ride in the calm waters of a lake. From the backwaters of Alleppey to the lake city\nUdaipur\n(click) and the hill station of\nNainital\n(click),\u00a0lakes are at the center of all tourist attractions. Dal lake is no exception. But for me, the charm of a shikara (small boat) ride in Dal lake is unmatchable.\nShikara ride in Dal lake\nWith the great Himalayas in the backdrop, the calm blue waters of the lake make for a spectacular sight. The colourful shikars took us around the lake, first to a peaceful part, and then through the floating markets of Dal lake. I found the shikara-vendors selling\nkahwa\n(a Kashmiri hot beverage), and other craft products to be a very interesting sight. However, riding a boat through the floating shops\nmostly\nselling Kashmiri hand-made textile products was absolutely fascinating.\nAnother memorable experience at the lake was visiting the Gulshan Book-Cafe. Do ask your shikara rider for the cafe and spend an hour there.\nPassing through the floating market\nHouseboats of Dal Lake:\nThough people call them houseboats, I prefer calling them boat-houses as they are not boats in real meaning of the term. Unlike boats, they don\u2019t really float around the lake; they float, but are stuck to the ground on the bank of the lake. They are bigger than the houseboats of\nAlleppey in Kerala\n, and give an experience of a resort.\nThough we didn\u2019t have the opportunity of staying in the houseboats, I\u2019m sure that watching sunrises and sunsets must be special experiences from those houseboats. Moreover, they look fascinating enough from within the lake to go around them.\nHouseboats | Dal Lake\nGardens of Srinagar:\nSrinagar has to be the city with maximum number of beautiful gardens in India.\u00a0 Though Bangalore,\nOoty\n, Kodaikanal and\nDelhi\nwould give it a stiff competition, still Srinagar would win it hands down! In fact, t\nhe gardens of Srinagar are easily comparable to and often better than those in Europe (see:\nParis\n|||\nGeneva\n|||\nAmsterdam\n).\nAmong the most beautiful gardens in Srinagar, the three Mughal Gardens come to my mind first:\nNishat Bagh\n|\nShalimar Bagh | Chasme Shahi Garden\n. Nishat Bagh is the largest one, and the most impressive. Situated on the foothills of Zabarwan mountains (part of Pir Panjal range of Himalayas) on one side, and Dal lake on the other, one cannot ask for better views! The terraced garden is a feast to the eyes with hundreds of varieties of flowers, and the magnificent Chinar trees (that resemble maple trees). It has been enchanting the visitors since 1633!\nView of Dal lake from Pari Mahal\nApart from the Mughal Gardens, the other must-visit gardens are:\nPari Mahal\n|\nIndira Gandhi Tulip Garden\n(Asia\u2019s largest tulip garden) |\nNehru Memorial Botanical Garden | Harwan Garden | Naseem Bagh, in descending order of my favorites list.\nFor want of time, if you want to prioritize, at least visit the ones in bold letters above. Pari Mahal gives the best panoramic view of the Dal lake.\nPlease note that the Tulip garden opens only from end-March to April, the spring-summer season.\nPopular Muslim shrines in Srinagar:\nIrrespective of whether you want to visit the shrines of Srinagar for reasons of faith or not, they are absolutely worth visiting for their architectural beauty. The two most important Muslim shrines in Srinagar are the Hazratbal Shrine and the Jamia Masjid.\nHazratbal Shrine\nHazratbal shrine:\nBuilt in the 17th century, this is one of the most important Muslim shrines in India as it hosts strands of hair of the Prophet Muhammed himself! The shrine, also known as Dargah Sharif, is as much popular among locals as among travellers. It has a long and quite\ninteresting history\n(click to read).\nFor a long time, it has been a symbol of Kashmir\u2019s communal harmony.\nWe spent an evening at the shrine and loved the experience. From the shrine\u2019s campus, the panoramic view of the lake with a backdrop of the mountains was quite a spectacle. We sat there at the steps leading to the lake for more than an hour.\nJamia Masjid:\nThe most important mosque in Srinagar, Jamia\nMasjid\nwas first built in 1402. Afterwards, it was rebuilt by the Mughals. I loved its architecture especially because of its novelty. Instead of the regular dome structure, it has a pyramidal shape, mostly inspired by Persian architectural style, with some resemblance with Buddhist Pagodas.\nEnamored by its unique design (by seeing in pictures), I had decided to definitely visit this mosque. On the last day of our trip, while coming back from Sonmarg to catch our flight, we were actually running a little late. Still then, I requested our driver to make a quick stop at the mosque.\nIn spite of suffering severe damages due to major fires three times in its history, it still dazzles as ever, and can host up to 33000 worshippers at a time.\nJamia Mosque, Srinagar\nDoodhpathri\nFor me, the second in the list of best places to visit in Kashmir in summer is Doodhpathri (literally: milky-rock). Though many visitors give it a miss, we made it a point to spend a good part of a day here. In fact, not having a large crowd was a major reason for enjoying the views and tranquility even more. Could you believe, i\nt\u2019s just about 45 kms from Srinagar, but still is a hidden gem!\nWe loved its enchanting meadows and the valley with river Shaliganga flowing through milky white rock beds.\nThe valley has two major points of attraction: the meadows and the river valley.\nDoodhpathri Valley\nFirst we headed to the river point where we crossed over to the other side over a small wooden bridge. Indeed, true to its name the rock bed looked milky white, and the water too looked white! Shaliganga river flowing through the pine forests over the white rock bed made for a painting-like scenery.\nWhile coming back, we stopped over at the meadows. What a pleasant sight that was! With very few tourists around, we went up to a picnicking local family to strike a nice chat. I loved having conversation with a local shepherd who was attending to his sheep grazing at the meadow. Whenever next time I\u2019m in Srinagar, I\u2019ll try to revisit this charming place.\nA shepherd | Doodhpathri\nPahalgam\nPahalgam (90 kms from Srinagar) is famous for its stunning valleys like Betaab valley, Aru valley and Baisaran valley. On reaching Pahalgam, we realized that not all the valley are reachable by car. From Pahalgam, there are two routes. While one goes towards Betaab valley and Chandanwadi, the other takes you to Aru valley and Lidder river valley. One of Kashmir\u2019s most beautiful treks, the\nTarsar-Marsar lake trek\nbegins from Aru.\n{Similar reading suggestion:\nCamping in Zanskar- Ladakh\n|||\nTriund Trekking\n}\nHowever, to reach the most stunning beauty of them all- the Baisaran valley, one must take a pony ride. On that ride only, they take you to a few more view points like Dabyan, Deno valley and Kashmir valley.\nBaisaran Valley, a hidden gem\nWe took that difficult pony ride across the hills to the Baisaran valley, which people fondly call \u2018Mini Switzerland\u2019. It was raining a bit before we reached Pahalgam. So, the narrow pathway up the hill was slippery, which made the ride even more difficult. However, it was okay, as even my mom could take the ride. In fact, she enjoyed the challenge of that trecherous ride. As they say, the best views come after the hardest journey.\nOnce we reached the Baisaran valley, one view of the hidden meadow, and all our pain was gone! It was a stunning sight with snow-capped mountains (Pir Panjal range) and deep green pine forests surrounding the valley. We spent more than half a day there walking around the lush green grounds and taking pictures with rabbits and pigeons.\nPahalgam undoubtedly, has to be there in the top five best places in Kashmir to visit in the summer.\nParina enjoying with the pigeons\nGulmarg\nNext on the list of best places to visit in Kashmir in summer has to be Gulmarg, 50 kms away from Srinagar.\nIt offers the best winter sports avenues in India. However, w\ninter is a difficult time for me to tolerate the chilling cold. So, even t\nhough Gulmarg is a round-the-year destination, I prefer the summer.\nIn summer, one can take the gondola (cable car) ride up to the snow point, and enjoy some skiing as well. Moreover, the large meadow with a small hill, atop which there is a small Shiva temple makes for a gorgeous sight. From near this central meadow, one has to take the gondola.\nAll of us in Gulmarg\nThe Gondola ride:\nFor us, the most awaited activity of the trip was taking this gondola ride.\nWe reached there late in the morning, and took the gondola right away to the snow point. We had to wear those long boots and extra-jackets that we got from a vendor. However, I don\u2019t think it was really necessary. Maybe the boot was a bit helpful, but the jacket was not required (the normal jacket that we were wearing, would have been enough).\nThe view from the gondola was wonderful, and the ride was exciting, to say the least. At the top, walking over the snow, the smile on the face of my mother was very special to me. She was so happy! Parina did some skiing, but I don\u2019t like trying out these things for 30 minutes!\nThe gondola ride has two phases. We rode up to phase-1 only. From the end of phase-2, one can trek up to (5 kms) the Alpather lake, beyond which is the Apharwat peak.\nOnce back to the central meadows, we took a pony ride around the meadow. The snow-clad mountains overlooking the green meadow was a stunning sight! There is a small market near the meadows, where we had our modest lunch, and left for Srinagar to reach before the evening.\nParina trying skiing | Gulmarg\nThings to do in Gulmarg:\nGondola ride to snow point; enjoy snow sports up there\nWalk around the central meadow and hike up to the Shiva temple\nTrekking to Alpather lake; the lake remains partially frozen even in the summer. Alternately, one can take a pony ride, or gondola ride to reach there.\nRide a pony up to Khilanmarg (only 5 kms away)\nPlay golf at the golf course just on the outskirts of Gulmarg\nSonmarg\nLast but not the least, Sonmarg has to be there on the list of best places in Kashmir to visit in summer. We visited this gorgeous valley on the last day of our trip. It\u2019s about 90 kms from Srinagar, and takes about 2 hrs to reach.\nWhen we drove up to Sonmarg in May, the roads were cut through thick layers of snow! So, the route doesn\u2019t open till late April or May; and they close in late October.\nSince this route goes towards Ladakh,\u00a0the view of snow-clad mountains gets more frequent on this route. All over the route, the sight of small streams formed out of the glaciers, flowing between two mountains makes the route picture perfect!\nSonmarg is famous for the lakes and the treks. We were a big group with my mom being part of it. So, trekking was out of question. However, we did hike up to the Thajiwas glacier (9186 ft), the origin of Sind river. Standing on the awe-inspiring glacier was an amazing experience.\nIf you have time, you may explore the nearby areas of Baltal valley and Zoji La pass. Sonmarg is especially popular among trekkers in the summer for it offers some of the most amazing trek routes in India.\nTreks in Sonmarg:\nKashmir Great Lakes Trek:\nSonmarg is the base location for this famous, but difficult trek. The lakes on the trek (in sequence) are:\nVishansar lake \u2013\nKrishansar lake \u2013\nGadsar lake \u2013\nSatsar lake \u2013\nGangabal lake \u2013\nNandkol lake. Read a useful article on the\ndetailed trek route\n.\nOther major treks: Amarnath peak | Machoi peak | Sirbal peak | Kalahoi peak.\nPainting-like landscape | Sonmarg\nBeyond the best places in Kashmir\nOf course, there are some more wonderful destinations in Kashmir beyond my list of best places in Kashmir to visit in the summer.\nGurez Valley:\nKishanganga river | Wular lake | Razdan pass | Dawar swamp | Habba Khatoon peak\nYusmarg:\nIt\u2019s believed that Jesus visited this valley. Major attractions: Sang-e-safed (white rocks) | Pakharpora shrine | Nilang lake\nPulwama:\nTarsar- Marsar lake | Aharbal falls | Avantishwar temple.\nAnantnag:\nMartand sun temple | Jhelum river.\nBest Places in Kashmir: Travel Tips\nBest time to visit:\nFor pleasant weather: April to September (though roads to northern Kashmir open only in May)\nFor winter sports/ snow view: December to March.\nHow to reach:\nThe best way is to reach Srinagar by air\nNearest railway station, Udhampur is more than 200 kms away! Jammu Tawi (270 kms) is also an important station\nRegular bus services from Jammu, Delhi and Chandigarh.\nWhere to stay in Srinagar:\nSome budget hotels:\nDal View Resort | Aala Residency | Nishat View | Curio\u2019s All Seasons | Grand Habib | Pacific | Green Ville | Al Mehar\nBudget Houseboats:\nYoung Manhattan | Young Goodluck | Jewel In the Crown | New Golden Lily\nHostels:\nUrban Den | GoStops | Zostel | Orania | Gypsys Homestay.\nThe guesthouse | Kashmir University\nHow to move around:\nIf you have enough time, you may take local buses\nIn case time is short on hand, cabs/ taxis are the best way to move around\nWhere to eat in Srinagar:\nGolden Chinar | Kullad Chai | Gulshan cafe | Tao restaurant & cafe | Cafe Liberty | Lhasa restaurant | Chaai Jaai | Books & Bricks | Winterfell cafe | Goodfellas cafe | 14th Avenue.\nMust try food: Kashmiri Dum Aloo, Rogan Josh, Goshtaba, Kahwa, Yakhni, Noon Chai\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019ts:\nFirst check\nsafety tips\nfrom the J&K police\nCarry your documents- identity cards, address proof, etc.\nKeep the phone always with location feature turned on\nDon\u2019t start discussing politics; even if it starts somehow, don\u2019t argue with them\nCarry your woolens, even in the summer\nAlso carry your rain jacket and umbrella; it can rain in the summers\nHaving good quality shoes for rough terrains is a good idea\nBe ready to live without phone for a while, if network issues arise.\nConcluding thoughts on the best places in Kashmir\nOne cannot \u2018experience\u2019 all that Kashmir has to offer in five days. But our trip had a bit of everything: from boat rides to gondola rides, from romancing the tranquil waters of the lake to encountering the snowy mountains, we had it all. Whenever people have asked me about my favorite landscape experience, Kashmir has always sprung up in my mind first. It\u2019s just picture perfect. Even if you take a picture with your eyes closed, you won\u2019t be disappointed with the output.\nHowever, I remember Kashmir not only for its natural beauty.\nIt was not only rejuvenating for the battered soul, but also enriching for the hungry mind. I always wanted to experience that mystical land that is heaven on one hand and the center of many a controversies/ conflicts on the other. I haven\u2019t shared much of my interactions with the locals and their viewpoints for obvious reasons. But those conversations were indeed an eye-opener.\nI hope this piece on the best places in Kashmir to visit in the summer is enjoyable for your reading, and is also helpful for your planning. Or, you can always write to us for more details.\nRelated",
